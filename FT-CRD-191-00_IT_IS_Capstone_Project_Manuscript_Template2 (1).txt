INTRODUCTION
Project Context

      The restaurant industry is a vital part of the economy, yet many establishments face operational inefficiencies due to outdated sales and inventory management systems. Restaurants in the Philippines still adopt largely manual processes or non- integrated systems, resulting in stock shortages, over-purchasing, and financial losses incurred as a result of delayed order processing. All of these affect profitability and customer satisfaction along with efficiency.
      One of the biggest problems that restaurant owners and managers face is keeping track of their inventories. Manual recordkeeping often gives false stock levels whereby the records show a shortage that interrupts service, or a surplus of stock that could go to waste. In addition, time-consuming but error-prone processes characterize tracking sales and creating financial reports, making it a hard rip for restaurant owners to make better-informed decisions for their business. Strategic planning and cost control have so faced their own hurdles by lack of real-time insights into sales trends and stock usage.
      Inefficiencies in order processing add to the bottlenecks in operations, which, alongside traditional methods, such as written notes or a verbal exchange of information between the staff and kitchen, increase likelihood for error. Such inefficiencies in service slow down, create wrong orders, and raise customer dissatisfaction. A fragmented, non-centralized order system along sales tracking and inventory management makes restaurant operations less efficient.
      ServeWise: SaaS Restaurant Sales and Inventory Management System would offer such a solution to install on a cloud platform where an integrated sales monitoring, order processing, and inventory management application is intended. It brings in real- time stock monitoring, automated low-stock alerts, supplier order management, and financial reporting to the owners, managers, and staff of these restaurants. ServeWise makes use of cloud technologies for such access over many devices to become available for use in remote monitoring and expansion of effective restaurant controls.

      This also encompasses access based on roles assigning the employees to process orders and payments while managers create reports, track the use of inventory and manage suppliers' transactions. Their automatic features minimize human errors, perfect communication between restaurant staff, and fulfill the ordering. ServeWise offers data analytics and reporting tools that give restaurant owners the right information to make learned decisions regarding pricing strategies, menu offerings, and resource allocation in the restaurant.
      ServeWise comes at a very opportune time and is very practical given the present scenario in the country, where most restaurants are still struggling to go digital. The rampant use of contactless payments, online orderings, and cloud-based business solutions attests to the need for an integrated restaurant management system. ServeWise is an accessible and adaptable solution in effect to assist small and mid-sized restaurants in improving their operational efficiency through reduced financial losses and customer satisfaction levels. This research aims to modernize restaurant operations in the Philippines, which will be a critical tool in helping businesses compete in an increasingly fast-evolving market.

Purpose and Description

      This project seeks to produce an online restaurant management system where managers and owners of restaurants can efficiently manage daily activities. The system allows the users to register and sign in to access a dashboard that shows financial and inventory status, sales status monitoring, kitchen inventory management, order processing, and planning for smooth restaurant operations. The system will automate very critical tasks such as monitoring stock levels, alerts on low inventory, helpful in making informed business decisions for restaurant owners, enhances kitchen operation because of directing order stream on delays and waste. This project also streamlines internal operations of the restaurant to enhance standards of efficiency, minimize errors, and maximize profitability, as it offers real-time, data-driven, and integrated approaches to the restaurant management world to eliminate all these challenges.
      In addition, some of the significant features included in the system would be real-time inventory tracking, automated order processing, sales monitoring, and financial reporting. This implies that the owners and managers could control their activities better and with more flexibility because they are in a cloud-based technology through this system. The system also eases the conduct of supplier transactions for timely and coordinated stock replenishment to avoid disruption of service.
      ServeWise can be also used on improving the order processing, thus enabling the kitchen staff to receive timely, precise order details. Order entry is automated to prevent and make stat updates directly into the inventories, thus increasing efficiency. Detailed financial reports facilitate better sales tracking and enable evaluation of business performance for strategy development. Role-based access control is part of this platform, meaning specific tasks can only be performed by authorized individuals, thus increasing security and accountability.

      Integrating inventory management, sales tracking, and order processing under a single platform will improve efficiency and reduce waste toward profitability, as this project will offer practical and scalable solutions to support that transformation

Limitations

      The ServeWise system does have a few limitations, which the research team cannot change. First, for cloud-based applications, a stable internet connection is required for proper system functioning. In cases where a restaurant is located in areas with poor internet connectivity, the system's ability to operate in real time may be affected.

      Second, the implementation of the system is currently limited to small and medium-sized restaurants. Larger establishments with more complex business processes may require deeper customization or integration with existing enterprise solutions, which are beyond the scope of this study.

      Third, ServeWise does not support managing multiple restaurant branches under a single account. Each branch must operate independently, with separate user accounts, data inputs, and reporting dashboards. For restaurant chains, this may result in duplicated workload and inconsistent consolidation of operational data.

      Fourth, the inventory management module focuses exclusively on food ingredients. The system does not support tracking non-food inventory such as utensils, cleaning supplies, furniture, or equipment. Restaurants requiring complete stockroom management may need additional systems or future module extensions to handle these categories.

      Last of all, only the core functionalities of restaurant operations are covered in the current version. Features such as customer relationship management (CRM), loyalty programs, mobile applications, advanced analytics, and AI-driven forecasting are not included in the initial rollout.

      ServeWise, as a restaurant sales and inventory management system, still provides a comprehensive digital solution to many operational challenges faced by food service establishments. While it has notable limitations, the system significantly contributes to efficiency, accuracy, and operational organization-making it a valuable tool for restaurants aiming to modernize their processes. Despite constraints in multi-

branch support, inventory coverage, scalability, and internet dependency, ServeWise successfully addresses the essential needs of small to medium-sized restaurants through streamlined sales monitoring, automated inventory tracking, and simplified order processing.

      The limitations identified in this study also highlight meaningful opportunities for system enhancement. Future developers may explore expanding ServeWise to include multi-branch consolidation, broader inventory management capabilities, offline-ready features, and extended modules such as CRM, supplier portals, mobile applications, and advanced analytics. By recognizing these areas for growth, the study not only evaluates the system's current capabilities but also creates a clear direction for continuous improvement. Ultimately, ServeWise establishes a strong foundation for digital restaurant management and offers valuable insights that can guide future innovations in the food service technology landscape.

Review of Related Literature/Studies/Systems

Online Restaurant Management and Advertising System (Piyush Patil, Kailas Patole, Hardik Variya, Vijaya Pinjarkar, 2022)

      According to the study, the aim of the project was to create a responsive website of restaurants that help customers to order food online. in conjunction with this, the application should respond because the website will be available on devices with completely different screen sizes. and the project allows advertising on the website while the client views the menu. Therefore, restaurants will build their reputation and a simple customer community.

      On the website, the login module will allow customers and restaurants to enter while they are registered on the website. Every manager / user will have a login id and password to log in to the website. This registration module is shown to visitors when they need to place specific orders, and new restaurant registrations that want to do business with them on their online restaurant management website. Once confirmation has been made through the website, the order is confirmed, and delivery will be delivered to the address of the dedicated customer. The Pay Bill is Work done by customer. The customer will have the option to pay off the debt online or pay off the debt in cash. The final module states that after placing an order or doing other things on the website the customer will click on the exit profile.

Web-based Integrated Restaurant Management System (Linda Uchenna Oghenekaro, Jacinta Chielozonam Okafor, 2023)

      The study of Linda Uchenna Oghenekaro and Jacinta Chielozonam Okafor aimed to develop wed-based restaurant management information system offers, a web- based food ordering system with POS, cashier, kitchen, tables that can be adjusted to meet the requirements of restaurant businesses to increase inventory positions, increase profits, and better customer service by optimizing workforce needs and reduce operating costs.

      According to the study of Linda Uchenna Oghenekaro and Jacinta Chielozonam Okafor, the existing system is characterized with many problems which are staff are taking too much time pursuing mistakes instead of tending to customers, inventory doesn't match your tallies, sales going unrecorded, and other. Restaurant personnel use computerized management database information systems to gather data, process data and keep it for future use and product ordering. The proposed system was implemented using HTML/CSS for the user interface, PHP and MYSQL database for the back end. Structured system analysis and design methodology were adopted. The system designed will allow the pliability to the Users/ Customers to order from Restaurants.

Web-based Inventory Management System (Tanaman et al., 2023)

      The study of Tanaman et al. (2023) aimed to develop a web-based inventory management system to help a small business enterprise in Pagadian City, Philippines, automate its inventory tracking and sales reporting. The system focuses on resolving inefficiencies in manual inventory management, where paper-based processes led to errors, delays, and lack of real-time data visibility. According to Tanaman et al. (2023), the primary problem faced by the business was the manual handling of inventory requests and sales reports, which relied on paper forms. This method was prone to data inaccuracy due to lost or damaged forms, as well as inconsistencies from multiple employees recording data on the same documents. Additionally, generating sales reports was time-consuming since calculations were done manually using spreadsheets, leading to inefficiencies in stock management. The lack of a centralized system also made it difficult for the business owner to monitor inventory levels across four branches and a mobile store in real time.

      By transitioning from a paper-based to a web-based system, the business can now manage inventory more efficiently, reduce human errors, and improve overall operational productivity. The study highlights how digital solutions can address common challenges in small businesses, particularly in inventory management.

Synthesis
      In the Online Restaurant Management and Advertising System by Piyush Patil, Kailas Patole, Hardik Variya, Vijaya Pinjarkar, 2021. The e-Menu provides more information about menu items and drinks than the standard paper menu. The convenience and easy access to the local menu are the many things that make you order food during the restaurant. The service is moving very fast. In addition, the project allows advertising on the website

      On the other hand, Linda Uchenna Oghenekaro and Jacinta Chielozonam Okafor integrated restaurant management system, has proven to be a more cost effective and scalable solution for Sammies Fast-Food. It maintained features that allow users gain access to the application such as the shopping cart, which creates the platform for the pacing orders and make payments. The admin rights give the administrator the privilege of managing the activities of the restaurant. All available meals were also maintained on the food list page, and the information could be updated depending on the meals available at every given moment. Staffing was also maintained on the staff management page, where orders and reservations were easily allocated to staff.

      Tanaman et al. (2023) created a web-based inventory management system for a small business in the Philippines, automating inventory tracking and sales reporting to eliminate paper-based errors and provide real-time data visibility. This system enables seamless stock requests, warehouse processing, and centralized monitoring across multiple branches. These studies highlight the transformative potential of web-based systems in addressing common challenges such as manual inefficiencies, data inaccuracies, and lack of real-time visibility. The proposed solutions demonstrate scalability and applicability to similar businesses, emphasizing the importance of digital tools in improving operational efficiency and decision-making.

      The innovation in these systems lies in their ability to integrate multiple functionalities-such as online ordering, inventory tracking, and real-time reporting into a single platform, tailored to the specific needs of small and medium enterprises. By adopting such solutions, businesses can achieve greater accuracy, efficiency, and customer engagement, paving the way for sustainable growth.

METHODOLOGY
Technical Background

      Today's information technology landscape is rapidly evolving, demanding constant upgrades to tools and frameworks for building robust, easy-to-use, and scalable web-based systems that are highly efficient, reliable, and responsive. In this context, ServeWise is proposed as a SaaS (Software as a Service) restaurant sales and inventory management system that incorporates modern web development technologies to streamline restaurant operations and deliver a seamless experience to end users, including restaurant staff, managers, and suppliers. The development of ServeWise follows the Spiral Model, a risk-driven software development methodology that combines iterative design and systematic risk management across four main phases: Planning, Risk Analysis, Development and Testing, and Evaluation.

      In the Planning phase, the development team identified the system's core requirements through data gathering and research by analyzing the operational needs of modern restaurants, leading to the specification of modules for order processing, inventory tracking, sales monitoring, supplier management, and user role functionalities. This phase also included the selection of a suitable technology stack that ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

      In the Risk Analysis phase, the team assessed potential technical and operational risks such as system performance under load, data security, and user accessibility. Mitigation strategies were adopted, including the use of Laravel's built-in authentication and security mechanisms, normalized relational database design for optimized queries, and Vue.js's efficient rendering to maintain responsiveness across modules.

      The Development and Testing phase will utilize a local development environment powered by XAMPP, integrating Apache, PHP, and MySQL to support the Laravel framework on the backend and Vue.js on the frontend. HTML will provide the structural backbone, while Vue's component-based architecture will enable modular, dynamic interfaces tailored to different user roles. Laravel's MVC architecture and Eloquent ORM will streamline backend development, and rigorous

testing will be ensured that modules like real-time inventory updates, role-based access control, and transaction logging functions reliably.

       In the Evaluation phase, the website will be reviewed for usability, and real- user feedback from simulations guided continuous refinements to user experience and system logic. Evaluation results were cycled back into the planning phase of the next spiral iteration to support ongoing enhancement and adaptation of the system.

      Through this iterative and adaptive approach, ServeWise is being built as a robust and scalable system that effectively addresses the challenges of restaurant management. The selected technology stack-Vue.js, HTML, Laravel, and MySQL- encourages rapid prototyping, security, and future scalability. It enables efficient development without the immediate need for expensive infrastructure while providing a solid foundation for cloud deployment, third-party integrations, and large-scale adoption.

Resources
Hardware

      The development and testing of ServeWise were conducted using two distinct hardware devices to ensure the system performs efficiently across different setups. The first device used was an Acer Aspire Lite 15, running on Windows 11 Pro 64-bit. It is equipped with an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-core processor clocked at 3.70 GHz, 16 GB of RAM, and 1 TB of storage. This setup included an AOC 24B36H+ 23.8-inch monitor with a 120Hz refresh rate, providing smooth and responsive visual output. The second device was an HP desktop powered by an Intel Core i3 10th Gen processor with four cores running at 3.60 GHz. It also operated on Windows 11 Pro 64-bit, with 8 GB of RAM and 1 TB of storage. This system used an ACER EK220Q monitor with a 1920x1080 resolution and a 60Hz refresh rate. These two hardware configurations allowed the team to test the system's functionality under both high-end and mid-range conditions, ensuring compatibility and performance across a range of user environments.



Software

      For the software side, ServeWise was developed using a modern and efficient web development stack. Prototyping and UI mockups were created in Figma to design the system's interface before actual development. The backend was built using Laravel, a PHP framework that offers powerful features for routing, database management, and security. Data is stored and managed using MySQL, run locally through XAMPP, providing a reliable relational database environment. For the frontend, the team utilized Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework known for its flexibility and reactive components. This combination of tools and frameworks ensured the system was both visually appealing and functionally robust.

Requirements Analysis

      The development of ServeWise, a SaaS-based Restaurant Sales and Inventory Management System, began with a critical phase: requirements gathering and analysis. This stage was vital in ensuring the system would align with the practical needs of restaurant operations, particularly in areas like inventory tracking, sales monitoring, and staff coordination. From the outset, the team aimed to build a system that could adapt to real-world workflows and future demands in the food service industry.
      However, the process wasn't without challenges. Due to confidentiality concerns and restrictions related to the internal operations of restaurants, the team was unable to conduct extensive interviews with multiple establishments. In response, the development team adopted a research-driven approach to gather the necessary insights. This involved reviewing existing restaurant management software, analyzing how SaaS models were implemented in the food industry, and identifying key trends and common limitations in current systems.
      To supplement this research, the team engaged in informal conversations with individuals working in small food businesses. While these discussions didn't offer a comprehensive overview, they provided valuable, real-life perspectives on issues such as inventory control, order tracking, supplier coordination, and staff management.
      Through this methodical process, the team was able to identify a set of core features essential for different user roles within the system. ServeWise needed to include secure login functionality with role-based access control to ensure that users like managers, cashiers, and suppliers could only access the features relevant to their responsibilities. For example, cashiers needed tools to handle transactions, print receipts, and monitor daily sales, while managers required access to sales reports, inventory data, and overall business performance metrics. The supplier module had to support order requests, delivery status updates, and item listings.
      Equally important was the ability to generate reports and analytics. Managers needed to see daily, weekly, or monthly summaries to support decision-making. The team also recognized the importance of making the system scalable, so it could support small to medium-sized businesses and potentially integrate with other tools in the

future.

      Although the lack of in-depth interviews posed a limitation, the team made sure that every design decision was backed by research and grounded in realistic scenarios. By combining secondary research, case studies, and real user feedback, the team ensured that ServeWise would be both practical and responsive to the needs of restaurant operations.
      This careful, human-centered approach to requirements gathering laid a solid foundation for the next stages of development. It helped ensure that ServeWise would not only meet the current demands of restaurant owners and staff but also remain flexible enough to evolve with the industry's needs.

Requirements Documentation

      This section serves as a comprehensive record of the ServeWise Restaurant Management System's functional and non-functional requirements. It outlines the specific features, capabilities, and constraints that guided the system's development, ensuring a shared understanding between the development team and stakeholders. The process of requirements gathering involved detailed consultations and interviews with restaurant personnel, including managers, cashiers, waiters, and suppliers. This direct engagement was essential for identifying real-world operational needs, challenges with existing manual processes, and desired functionalities. The insights obtained were then carefully analyzed and translated into a structured set of system requirements.

      To clearly articulate these requirements and visualize the intended behavior and structure of ServeWise, a series of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams were employed. Use Case Diagrams captured the functional scope of the system from the perspectives of different users, including managers, staff, and suppliers. Sequence Diagrams illustrated the dynamic interactions between system components for specific scenarios, such as purchase order processing, customer billing, and subscription management. Activity Diagrams modeled detailed workflows and business processes, highlighting step-by-step operations for tasks such as menu planning, order handling, inventory logging, and damage or spoilage reporting. Finally, the Domain Diagram defined the core data entities-such as customers, orders, ingredients, suppliers, and subscriptions-and their relationships, providing a clear representation of the system's data structure.

      Collectively, these visual tools provided a detailed blueprint of ServeWise's design and operational flow. They ensured that the system's development aligned precisely with user needs, operational standards, and project objectives. This thorough documentation serves as a critical reference for the subsequent design, development, and testing phases, minimizing ambiguities and facilitating effective communication among the development team, stakeholders, and end-users.

Design of Software, System, Product, and/or Processes

      The design phase of ServeWise focused on crafting a comprehensive and user- centered system that addresses the operational challenges of restaurant management. ServeWise is envisioned as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that enables restaurants to streamline their sales processes, monitor inventory in real-time, manage staff, track supplier orders, and maintain visibility across business operations. This design phase emphasized both the functional structure of the system and the user experience, ensuring the product remains intuitive, scalable, and efficient for everyday use by various stakeholders such as restaurant staff, managers, suppliers, and administrators.

      To achieve a seamless and consistent user experience, Figma was used as the primary tool for user interface design. The design process included developing wireframes and interactive mockups for the landing page, login and registration screens, and multiple role-specific dashboards (Admin, Manager, Cashier, Supplier). Each page was crafted with usability in mind, following a structured layout and visual hierarchy that supports accessibility and clarity. Interactive components such as navigation menus, modals, forms, and tables were standardized across the design system, which not only ensures a cohesive user experience but also simplifies the development phase.

      To complement the functional and structural models, Sequence Diagrams were developed to illustrate the real-time flow of interactions between system components and actors across the major modules of ServeWise. These diagrams depict how requests are initiated, how the system processes each action step-by-step, and how responses are returned-providing a clear visualization of the dynamic behavior involved in Sales Processing, Inventory Management, Order Management, Reporting, and Subscription Management. By outlining the chronological exchange of messages, the Sequence Diagrams help identify the required system operations, interaction dependencies, data exchanges, and the coordination between internal components. This modeling approach ensures consistency between the system's intended workflows and its actual implementation, while also supporting the validation of process logic and the refinement of system behavior (Refer to pages 47 - 52, Figures 9 - 14).

      Use-case diagrams were employed to define and visualize the interactions between external actors and the system. These diagrams mapped out the key system functionalities from the perspective of each role-Administrator, Manager, Cashier, and Supplier-highlighting critical tasks such as managing inventory, processing sales, submitting supplier orders, generating reports, and handling user account administration. By modeling these interactions, the design team ensured complete functional coverage and user-specific capabilities that align with the real-world workflows of restaurant operations (Refer to pages 41 - 46, Figures 3 - 8).

      The Domain Diagrams formed the backbone of ServeWise's database design, illustrating the core entities-such as Users, Employees, Products, Inventory Logs, Sales, Orders, Suppliers, and Subscriptions-and their interrelations. The Domain diagrams were normalized to eliminate data redundancy and to enforce referential integrity through the use of primary and foreign keys. These diagrams helped visualize how data flows between modules and supported the development of a scalable and efficient relational schema (Refer to page 53 - 58, Figure 15 - 20).

      The system's workflows and operational processes are modeled using Activity Diagrams, which provide a clear representation of the step-by-step activities within ServeWise. These diagrams capture the dynamic flow of tasks across core modules such as employee management, inventory tracking, sales processing, order management, subscriptions, and supplier coordination. By visualizing the sequence of actions, decision points, and parallel processes, the activity diagrams help ensure that business logic is accurately translated into the system's implementation. They serve as a blueprint for understanding process dependencies, identifying potential bottlenecks, and guiding the development of efficient and coherent workflows. This detailed modeling is essential for supporting accurate task execution, streamlining operations, and enabling the system to generate reliable reports, track trends, and facilitate automated decision-making within the application (Refer to page 59 - 64, Figures 21 - 26).

      In terms of system architecture, ServeWise adopts a multi-tier architectural approach that separates concerns across three primary layers: the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data layer. This separation supports scalability, modularity,

and easier maintenance. The presentation layer handles user interaction through the web interface, while the business logic layer processes application workflows, role-based access control, order computations, and other operational rules. The data layer manages interactions with the relational database. This architecture is ideal for a SaaS platform, as it allows for isolated scaling of individual components, enhances security by restricting direct access to data, and facilitates smoother system updates and feature expansion.

      To ensure flexibility and maintainability in the software logic, ServeWise integrates several key software design patterns. The Factory Pattern is employed to manage the creation of user roles and system entities dynamically. The Singleton Pattern ensures centralized access to critical resources such as configuration files or system logs. The Strategy Pattern is used in scenarios requiring dynamic selection of business rules, such as computing discounts, generating reports, or selecting payment processing methods. Meanwhile, the Observer Pattern supports reactive behavior- such as notifying managers when inventory levels are low or when new supplier orders are fulfilled. Complementing these object-oriented techniques, procedural programming is used for scripting specific workflows like daily report generation, stock reconciliation, and bulk data imports, allowing for a clean and task-oriented execution of linear processes.

      Altogether, the design of ServeWise integrates thoughtful user experience planning and comprehensive system modeling through the use of Use Case Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, and a Domain Diagram. These visual models collectively illustrate the system's functional scope, dynamic interactions, workflow processes, and underlying data structure. By combining these structured diagrams with a well-organized system architecture and sound programming principles, ServeWise is built on a strong foundation that ensures the system remains responsive, efficient, and maintainable. This cohesive design enables the platform to effectively support the operational needs of modern restaurant environments while allowing flexibility for future enhancements and scalability.

Development

      The development of the system followed a structured and standards-based approach to ensure reliability, maintainability, and scalability. The developers adopted the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using the Agile methodology, which allowed iterative development and continuous feedback from stakeholders. Each iteration involved planning, designing, coding, testing, and deployment activities to ensure that every system component met the defined functional and non-functional requirements.

      The system was primarily developed using Laravel as the backend framework and Vue.js for the frontend. Laravel provided a robust and secure environment for handling authentication, role-based access control, and database management through Eloquent ORM, while Vue.js ensured a responsive and dynamic user interface. The integration of Laravel Breeze facilitated the implementation of secure authentication features, and Spatie Roles and Permissions was used to manage user roles such as Manager, Supervisor, Cashier, Supplier, and Administrator.

      The development process adhered to industry standards for coding and documentation. Source codes were managed using Git and hosted on GitHub to maintain version control and enable team collaboration. Each developer worked on a dedicated branch for specific modules, ensuring that code reviews and merge requests- maintained code quality and minimized conflicts.

      Database design followed normalization standards to avoid redundancy and improve data integrity. MySQL was use as the database management system due to its reliability and compatibility with Laravel. All database tables were structured according to the data flow diagrams and entity-relationship models designed during the analysis phase.

      The frontend development emphasized usability and accessibility. Modern web design principles were applied to ensure an intuitive interface with consistent navigation and responsive layouts. The team also used Tailwind CSS to achieve a clean and scalable design system.

       System deployment was done using Railway, a cloud hosting platform that supports continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). Environment variables were properly configured to secure API keys and sensitive information. The developers also conducted functionality and integration testing to ensure that modules performed as expected when combined.

       Throughout the development, coding standards were guided by PSR-12 (PHP Standards Recommendation) and ESLint rules for JavaScript, ensuring consistency and readability. Comprehensive documentation was maintained to support future maintenance and scalability.

       In summary, the development process combined systematic planning, modern web technologies, and coding best practices to produce a high-quality, secure, and efficient system that meets the project objectives.
