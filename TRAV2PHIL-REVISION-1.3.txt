INTRODUCTION

Project Context
      Transportation is a cornerstone of national development, as it facilitates the          movement of people, goods, and services. Buses, vans, and ferries are among the most widely used transportation modes, often operating on inconsistent schedules, causing uncertainty and frustration between passengers. Overcrowding during peak hours makes the ride uncomfortable and increases the risk of accidents and health issues due to limited space and poor ventilation. Additionally, manual processing of fares slow down boarding times and increase the chances of delays. Accessible transportation is a fundamental component of urban and rural development, directly affecting people's mobility, productivity, and quality of life. Transportation access remains uneven, especially in places that are not accessible by some modes of transportation. The inability to find reliable or convenient transportation limits access to these certain places.

      Given the geographic makeup of the Philippines, comprising thousands of islands with varying levels of infrastructure, many destinations are not directly connected by a single transportation line. For instance, a traveler might need to ride a tricycle to a jeepney terminal, transfer to a bus, and then board a ferry to reach a specific destination. Without clear information on transfer points, schedules, and trip times, travelers are often left guessing or relying on word-of-mouth directions. Currently, there is a lack of an integrated system that helps travelers plan trips involving multiple transport connections. This results in missed connections, inefficient routes, and wasted time, particularly for first-time visitors or residents unfamiliar with transport patterns in a given area. The absence of reliable route planning tools makes mobility challenging in areas without centralized transportation systems or fixed schedules.
       
      This project proposes the development of a point-to-point multi-mode transportation system using QR Code as ticket. The system aims to assist travelers in navigating trips that require connecting different modes of transport such as tricycles, 
jeepneys, buses, ferries, or ride-hailing services to reach a destination. By inputting their starting point and desired endpoint, users will receive a detailed trip plan that includes available routes, estimated travel times, transfer points, and waiting times between connections. The system will address the transportation gaps in underserved and geographically complex areas by consolidating local route data and creating optimized travel pathways. Through this solution, the project seeks to improve travel efficiency, support local mobility, and enhance the overall transportation experience for both residents and tourists.

Purpose and Description

      The purpose of this study is to develop a transportation ticketing and suggestion system that assists travelers in identifying and navigating multi-step or connecting transportation routes from one location to another, particularly in areas where no single direct transport is available. By analyzing local transportation data and user locations, the system aims to provide optimized trip suggestions using a combination of available modes such as buses, ferries, and vans. This project seeks to improve trip efficiency, enhance user convenience, and address mobility challenges in geographically fragmented or under-served areas in the Philippines. Ultimately, the study aims to provide a scalable and data-driven solution to bridge transportation gaps and make local commuting more accessible and informed.
      The transportation suggestion system is a web-based platform designed to help   users find viable transport routes involving one or more connections to reach their destination. It caters to travelers who need to move between locations that are not connected by a single mode of transport. By allowing users to input a point of origin and a target destination, the system will process this data to identify nearby available transport services, determine possible transfer points, and suggest a step-by-step trip route. The end goal of the system is to assist both locals and tourists in navigating complex or unfamiliar areas with greater ease, helping reduce time spent planning routes and increasing the overall accessibility of transportation services.
Objectives
      The main objective of this study is to provide a transportation ticketing and trip recommendation engine that identifies and recommends multi-modal trip routes for users going from one point to another, especially in areas without direct transportation access in the Philippines. Specifically, this project aims:

* To develop a booking management module that can recommend connecting transportation options.
      Aside from identifying and recommending transport routes involving multiple modes of travel, this also enables users to book available transport options directly through the platform, whether one-way or round-trip. Also, the user can reschedule or cancel their booked tickets.

* To develop a unique QR-based ticket generation module for each transportation.
      This module will generate and issue one unique QR Code for a specific booking which will serve as their ticket or boarding pass throughout the entire trip. This QR will be scanned and validated by terminal or boarding staff.

* To design a payment module that integrates various payment methods.
      This module will compute total charges based on destination and additional fees,     confirm payment before ticket issuance, and issue receipts or confirmation messages to passengers, ensuring accurate and reliable transactions
* To develop a registration with subscription module for transportation companies.
      This module facilitates the submission, validation, and approval of necessary documents and credentials from transportation companies, such as business name registration, barangay clearance, vehicle registration documents, and franchise certificate of public convenience (CPC). This module also enables subscription registration, renewal processing, account activation and deactivation, and monitoring of subscription status.

* To develop a transportation company dashboard module.
      This module manages employee records within the transportation companies, including their status. This module also allows to manage trips including the origin, destination, and routes. In addition it also relates to schedules where transportation companies can set their availability for trips. Lastly, vehicles are managed in terms of its capacity and vehicle number, then assigned on the specific trips and schedules including the drivers and other personnel.


Scope and limitations
Scope

      This study focuses on the design and development of a web-based transportation suggestion and booking system aimed at assisting travelers in navigating from one location to another within the Philippines. The system is intended to help users, particularly in areas with limited direct transportation options, by recommending available routes through one or more connected transportation modes.
      
      This project will benefit the following:
      
* Travelers and Commuters

      Individuals traveling between various points in the Philippines, especially in areas with limited direct transportation, will benefit from the system's ability to suggest efficient and reliable routes. It will help reduce travel confusion, time spent on planning, and the stress of navigating unfamiliar areas. The option to book transport directly also increases convenience and safety.

* Tourists

  	Tourists unfamiliar with the local transport structure often struggle with fragmented routes and lack of signage. This system provides a guided, step-by-step travel plan with booking options, making tourism in less connected regions more accessible, organized, and appealing.




* Land and Sea Transport Operators and

      Participating transportation providers gain increased visibility and potential revenue by being included in a system that promotes their services to a wider audience. The booking functionality also helps them manage demand and schedules more efficiently.
     The key function of the system includes:
     
* Passenger Booking
       Allows the passenger to view available routes, select their seats, input trip details, and complete booking with a QR-based ticket issued upon confirmation.
      
* Payment Processing

        Supports multiple secure payments options and automatically computes total cost, including fare, and any applicable charges.

* QR Code Ticketing and Validation

       Each ticket generates a QR Code that can be scanned by conductors for secure and efficient boarding.

* Cancellation, Refund, and Reschedule

       Allows users to cancel/refund under certain conditions and allows users to reschedule their tickets with a certain fee.
      


* Connecting Transportation Suggestion

      When a direct route is unavailable, the system suggests a series of connecting transportation modes to complete the trip.

* Subscription

      Allows transportation companies to select different subscription plans from basic, standard, and premium.


     Limitations

     The system has several limitations that may affect its overall performance and reach. First, the availability and accuracy of transportation data are dependent on external sources such as local government units and transport operators, which may not always be up-to-date or comprehensive. Additionally, the system's geographic coverage may initially be limited to selected areas within the Philippines where sufficient data can be obtained, thereby excluding some remote or less-documented regions. 
     
     Real-time updates regarding delays, cancellations, or route changes are not guaranteed unless integrated with live data feeds, which may not be feasible in all cases. Furthermore, not all transportation modes, particularly informal or small-scale operators like tricycles or jeepneys, support online booking, limiting the system's booking functionality to only those services that have formal booking mechanisms. 
     
     The system also requires stable internet connectivity to function effectively, which may be a challenge in areas with poor network coverage. In addition, the current payment feature operates only in a sandbox environment and does not support live or real monetary transactions, which limits the system's ability to process actual payments from users. This setup is intended for testing and development purposes, but it means that full payment functionality will only be available in future phases once live payment integration is implement


REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE/STUDIES/SYSTEMS


Related Studies and/or System 
      This chapter presents a review of related literature, studies, and existing systems that support the development of Trav2Phil: A QR-Based Transportation Ticketing System in the Philippines. These studies and systems provide insights into digital ticketing, QR code verification, online booking, and transportation management, which help establish the foundation and relevance of the proposed system.
      Several local and international studies highlight the effectiveness of QR codes in improving operational efficiency within transportation services. QR-based systems are shown to reduce manual errors, accelerate passenger verification, and enhance security by providing unique, tamper-proof digital tickets. These findings support the implementation of QR technology in Trav2Phil, reinforcing its capability to simplify boarding procedures and minimize fraudulent ticket usage.
      Other related booking systems demonstrate the benefits of online scheduling and digital reservations. Prior studies emphasize how online booking platforms reduce long queues, improve customer satisfaction, and ensure better record-keeping for service providers. These insights parallel the objectives of the proposed system, which incorporates an online booking module that allows passengers to select routes, schedules, and generate digital tickets.
      Existing systems used by transport companies, such as mobile bus ticketing apps and railway e-ticket platforms, also show the importance of integrating secure authentication and real-time updates. These systems highlight features such as email verification, transaction history monitoring, and automated notifications-all of which are adopted in Trav2Phil to enhance user experience and operational transparency.
      Overall, the reviewed literature and systems demonstrate a clear trend toward digital transformation in transportation services. The insights from these studies validate the need for an efficient, accessible, and secure ticketing solution, forming the basis for the development of Trav2Phil as a modern alternative to traditional manual ticketing processes.
Smart Bus Ticketing System Using QR Code 

      Digital transformation in public transportation is gaining interest due to ineffective manual fare collection and paper ticket issuance. While handheld devices offer minor improvements, they require trained personnel and specific hardware. RFID and GPS-based systems aim to automate fare collection and enhance tracking, but they lack user-friendly features, mobile integration, and real-time interactivity. Bagde et al. (2022) proposed a smart bus ticketing system using QR codes and an Android app to streamline travel and payment processes. Their system enables users to register, choose routes, calculate fares, and make online payments, thereby expediting boarding and eliminating paper tickets. It also incorporates an SVM-based classification model for real-time travel data analysis.
Bus Pass Booking System Using QR code:
      Bus pass systems often face challenges such as long queues, manual errors, and the risk of losing paper-based passes. With digital technologies advancing, public transportation is steadily evolving. Dumbre et al. (2023) introduced a QR-code-based bus pass system that enables passengers to apply for passes online and receive a digital QR code upon approval. This method reduces paperwork and waiting time. It also provides security features and online payment options. Conductors can scan the QR code to validate the pass, and the system sends an alert message containing the location and usage time.
E- Ticket Booking System for Public Transportation using QR Code:
      Similarly, Putra and Nurdiansyah (2023) highlighted the benefits of using QR codes in public transportation. Their study showed that QR-based systems reduce wait times, increase reliability, minimize human error, and eliminate paper usage. These systems also enhance real-time tracking and data management while improving overall convenience and safety for both passengers and operators.
QR Code Based Booking System:
      Somani et al. (2023) developed a QR code-based booking system designed to simplify ticket purchases for public transportation. Their system allows users to reserve, modify, or cancel tickets online using a unique QR code as their boarding pass. This method reduces manual errors and queues, facilitates faster and more secure boarding, and supports real-time passenger monitoring to improve crowd management.
























Synthesis


      Recent research highlights a growing trend toward digitizing public transportation systems to address inefficiencies inherent in manual fare collection and paper-based ticketing. QR code-based systems have emerged as a practical solution for streamlining operations and improving passenger experience. Several studies support this shift. For instance, Bagde et al. (2022) developed a smart bus ticketing system that utilizes QR codes and an Android application, enabling users to register, select routes, and pay fares online. 
      Their system also integrates an SVM-based model to analyze real-time travel data, contributing to smarter transportation planning. Similarly, Dumbre et al. (2023) introduced a QR-based bus pass system that automates application, issuance, and renewal of passes, reducing paperwork and queue times while enhancing security through digital validation. Complementing these efforts, Putra and Nurdiansyah (2023) demonstrated that QR code systems can minimize human errors, shorten waiting times, and facilitate real-time data tracking, offering a secure and efficient alternative to traditional ticketing. 
      Adding to this, Somani et al. (2023) proposed a system that not only simplifies ticket booking and boarding through QR codes but also allows passengers to manage their reservations online, thereby improving convenience and operational efficiency. Collectively, these studies affirm the potential of QR code-based solutions to modernize fare systems, enhance user experience, and optimize public transport infrastructure.



METHODOLOGY
Technical Background
Overview of Current Technologies to be Used in the System 
     Technology plays a vital role in automating transportation systems, allowing operators to streamline ticketing processes, monitor transportation routes, and manage customer feedback more efficiently. With the increasing demand for digital transformation in the transport sector, traditional methods of ticket issuance and schedule tracking are gradually being replaced by modern, QR-based digital platforms. This project is designed to improve public transportation experience by introducing a platform that enables passengers to search for connecting transportation, scan QR Code for ticket validation, automate fare computation, and streamline schedule management. This System Ensures faster, contactless ticket processing, reduces fraud, and improves real-time tracking capabilities for bus operators.
     For front-end development, a framework of JavaScript will be used and it is React  that has a library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage their state efficiently. For back-end development, Laravel will be used in conjunction with MySQL, a reliable relational database, to manage ticket data, routes, schedules, and transaction history. The system architecture will be hosted on a XAMPP server during the development phase, simulating the production environment. It provides all the components required to operate the system locally and do testing, including Apache, MySQL, and Laravel. Security features such as role-based access control, data encryption, and input validation will be integrated to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Certain system components, such the administrator panel and driver dashboard, will only be accessible by authorized users.

     The development of the project will follow the Spiral Model, a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) approach that combines iterative development, risk management, and prototyping. This model is ideal for complex, multi-module systems like searching for connecting transportation, bus ticketing, which includes booking, scheduling, QR code generation, payments, and employee management. Each development cycle-consisting of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation-ensures flexibility, early validation, and continuous stakeholder feedback. By incorporating user input and addressing risks at every stage, the Spiral Model supports the creation of a reliable, user-friendly, and efficient system aligned with the needs of both passengers and bus operators
    
     The planning phase is the foundation of each cycle in the Spiral Model. The stage involves the developer's identifying system or module goals, developing a plan, collecting functional and non-functional requirements, considering technology, tools, and methodologies, schedule, and resource availability, and aligning developers and users.

     The risk analysis phase is the distinguishing feature of the spiral model. The project's risk identification phase identifies potential issues like scheduling conflicts and technical issues. These risks are assessed for likelihood and consequences, and mitigation techniques are suggested. Prototypes or simulations are used to evaluate risky ideas.
      
     Once the risks have been addressed, the Engineering Phase involves the actual development of the software. The system architecture will be developed, components will be built, and the application will be coded, with testing including integration and unit testing. 
      
     In the assessment Phase, the developed prototype or system increment will be presented to stakeholders for review and feedback. The Spiral Model ensures development meets business and user expectations by involving stakeholders in testing functionality, evaluating progress, and requesting enhancements, thereby ensuring the system is usable and meets user needs.
     
     
   
     
Calendar of activities
      The following shows the description of each activity finished and planned by the developers. Idea Brainstorming was conducted from the 1st week of February where the developers explore relevant issues to identify a suitable project idea. By the Following Week Title Creation took place which ensured that the topic aligned with identifying problems and proposed solutions.
	To improve comprehension of the system process, the developers presented their selected project concept during the second and third weeks of February, outlining the problem, solution, goals, and preliminary data flow diagram. To understand more about the selected project which is the bus ticketing system, interviews were conducted with the bus liners or bus company, However the developers were not allowed to conduct interviews with bus liners, so they instead looked for the general process and conducted research. 
	The team started drafting the Project Context in early March, focusing on the issues with conventional bus reservation systems. The Purpose and Description were then established, detailing how the project would provide a more effective, accessible, and user-friendly booking experience. To properly identify the elements of the web system, such as real-time seat tracking, digital payment, QR-based ticket production, and trip scheduling, this involved creating the project's objectives and outlining its scope and limitations. 
	As development proceeded, during the second and third weeks of March, the original documentation was revised in response to adviser input. New modules including bus timetable management, refund and cancellation procedures, and platform-based item delivery support were added in these revisions.
	To better support the project, the developers looked for a similar system to identify gaps by doing Review of Related Studies and System that took two weeks to complete 
	This helps the developers to understand how other systems work and what improvements they could make in their own system. In the same week, the developers worked on the Technical Background, where the developers explained what programming language, system design, and tools that they planned to use.
      The team concentrated on the requirements analysis from the third week of  March    to the third week of April. The team ensured that all user and system needs were addressed and incorporated into the features during this time. 
      
      To illustrate how users would interact with the system, how the database would be structured, and how the bus ticketing procedure would operate, they also produced system diagrams. They enumerated every item required for the project, including software, web hosting, and testing equipment. They ultimately finished the Appendix, which contained the developer profiles, UI designs, and diagrams, as well as the Requirements Documentation.
      
      All tasks were done according to the timeline shown in the Gantt chart, helping our group stay organized and on schedule.

Resources
	The development of the Bus Ticketing and Management System required combination of hardware and software resources to support coding, testing, deployment, and demonstration. Development was primarily conducted on personal computers and laptops equipped with AMD Ryzen 7 7730U with Radeon Graphics, 16 Gigabytes of RAM, 500GB of SSD, and Intel Core i5-1035G1 of CPU with 8GB of RAM on 256GB of SSD to ensure smooth operation of development environments and testing platforms. 
      For mobile testing and responsiveness, Android smartphones with at least 3GB RAM and running Android 8 or higher were used to simulate commuter-side interactions, including QR code scanning, ticket display, and payment processes. In some cases, tablets with larger displays were used to simulate the view of ticketing staff, which is the conductor.
     
      On the software side, the system was developed using a full-stack framework, including technologies such as React for the front-end, Laravel for the backend, and MySQL as the database management system. QR code functionality was tested using both browser-based tools and mobile QR scanning applications. The integrated development environment (IDE) used included Visual Studio Code, while version control was managed via Git and GitHub.
     
      Cloud-based services and virtual machines were utilized for staging and testing, simulating real-time operations without disrupting existing infrastructures. Additionally, web browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox were used for cross-browser compatibility testing. These resources collectively supported the development of a robust, responsive, and scalable system suitable for both administrative users and everyday passengers.
    
Requirements gathering and analysis

	The developers have performed data gathering and research to determine the necessary requirements that should be defined for the project. A letter and a set of questions were formulated by the members to be used as a research instrument for relevant people related to the project. Though, the developers tried to request the people involved but were unable to conduct the said interview.	
      As a result, thorough research was carried out. This includes the general process of ticketing and booking, transportation vehicles, people included in the vehicle such as drivers and conductors, fares, and passengers.
     
      This information was used to write the project's purpose, description, objectives, scope, and limitations. In addition, the diagrams such as use case, data flow, entity relation, database, and prototype were referred to the gathered data. 


Requirements documentation
      This document outlines the design and requirements of a web-based interface aimed at improving passenger travel experience through a visually engaging and easy-to-navigate ticket booking page, and transportation company dashboard page.
Use Cases:

Booking Management Module

     The Booking Management Module enables passengers to search for routes, view available schedules, and book trips based on their chosen origin, destination, and travel date. It supports both direct and connecting trips through its route recommendation feature. The module also allows users to manage their reservations by rescheduling or canceling bookings. Overall, it ensures a smooth and organized booking process within the system

      After completing the functional test cases for login, registration, booking, and QR validation, the proponents further examined the system's data management and overall performance beyond basic input handling. For example, the booking module was evaluated to ensure that passenger-selected routes, schedules, and fares were accurately saved in the MySQL database and correctly displayed across all user dashboards. The QR code generation process was tested to verify that each booking produced a unique and scannable code, which drivers could successfully validate using mobile QR scanning applications, ensuring accurate boarding verification and prevention of duplicate ticket usage.
      Forms for registration, email verification, and booking submission were checked to confirm that all passenger information, including personal details and transaction history,  was stored securely and reflected consistently across the system. Core data operations-such as creating new bookings, updating booking statuses, and storing validation logs-became a primary focus during testing. Administrators validated route creation, fare updates, and schedule modifications, ensuring that all changes propagated instantly across interfaces without inconsistencies. Each update was confirmed through real-time data refreshes, allowing both drivers and passengers to view accurate and synchronized information.
      To assess system resilience, error-handling scenarios were simulated. These included attempting to process a booking during slow internet connectivity, scanning an invalid or expired QR code, and interacting with the system during temporary database latency. In each case, the system responded gracefully by displaying clear, user-friendly prompts such as "Unable to process request. Please try again." while internally logging the issue for review. Input validation was also tested by intentionally submitting incomplete or incorrect fields, confirming that the system prevented errors and maintained data intgrity.
	Stress testing was conducted to evaluate performance under simultaneous booking attempts. The system remained stable, with consistent loading times and no data loss across concurrent transactions. QR validation accuracy was also tested using multiple   devices, confirming reliable scanning and immediate status updates in the driver and  admin dashboards.
	These comprehensive tests validated the system's functionality, reliability, and usability using both white-box and black-box methods. The results demonstrate that Trav2Phil successfully handles diverse scenarios, ensuring accurate data recording, secure ticketing workflows, and seamless coordination between passengers, drivers, and administrators. This testing phase confirmed that the platform is intuitive, stable, and ready for wider deployment in transportation ticketing operations.

A support channel or feedback form will also be provided to collect reports from users regarding issues or suggestions for future updates.
Conclusion and Recommendations	
      Based on the testing results, the first conclusion is that the system effectively streamlines the ticketing process by automating registration, booking, and QR-based validation. This significantly reduces manual work, minimizes human errors, and improves the reliability of traditional ticketing operations.
	The second conclusion is that the system ensures secure and accurate data handling. All records-such as passenger information, booking details, schedules, refund requests, and ticket history-were properly stored, updated, and retrieved during testing. This confirms the system's reliability and consistency in handling essential transportation data while maintaining data integrity.
	The third conclusion is that the system enhances overall service efficiency for both passengers and transportation staff. Features such as real-time schedule viewing, automated email verification, subscription processing for companies, and unique QR ticket generation improved user convenience and operational workflow. The structured dashboard also enabled transportation companies to efficiently manage vehicles, routes, employees, and schedules.
      Furthermore, the testing results show that the system successfully supports multi-module integration. From booking management to company subscriptions and trip scheduling, each component functions cohesively. The ability to generate data-driven insights-such as popular routes and active bookings-demonstrates the system's potential to support informed decision-making for transportation companies.
      Overall, the system proves to be a functional, dependable, and scalable digital ticketing platform. With proper deployment and continuous enhancement, it can significantly contribute to improving transportation accessibility, operational efficiency, and passenger experience in various regions of the Philippines.

Recommendations
	Based on the conclusions, it is recommended that future enhancements focus on integrating additional online payment methods such as GCash, PayMaya, or debit/credit card processing. Adding these payment options will further streamline the booking process, reduce the need for on-site transactions, and support a fully digital and contactless workflow for passengers.
	It is also recommended to deploy the system on a live and secure hosting environment. This includes implementing SSL certificates for encrypted communication, automated backup systems, and stronger authentication mechanisms. These measures will help ensure the safety of user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain consistent system availability for both passengers and transportation administrators.
	Another recommendation is to enhance system scalability by optimizing server performance and database structure. Since transportation services experience peak seasons and unpredictable traffic spikes, a scalable infrastructure will ensure that the system remains responsive and stable even during high booking volume.
      Future developers may also consider integrating real-time GPS tracking for vehicles. This feature would allow passengers to monitor estimated arrival times, track delays, and receive live notifications about trip updates. Such enhancement would greatly improve transparency and user trust.
      Further research may explore the addition of advanced analytics for transportation companies. This may include dashboards for passenger volume trends, revenue forecasting, peak travel time analysis, or route performance evaluation. These insights would help companies make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and enhance service delivery.
      Finally, continuous user testing and feedback gathering are recommended to ensure that future versions of the system remain user-friendly and aligned with the needs of passengers and transport operators. Regular updates and iterative.
