- Included TypeScript types and interfaces
- Showed both correct and incorrect patterns

### 3. Visual Aids
- ASCII art system architecture diagram
- Directory tree structures
- Technology stack tables

### 4. Rules Compliance
- ✅ No backward compatibility imports used
- ✅ All responsive values use scale utilities
- ✅ Documentation placed in `docs/` folder
- ✅ Following current TypeScript path aliases

## Critical Information for AI Agents

### Must Follow Rules:
1. **Import Patterns**: Always use `@backend/convex/` not relative paths
2. **Styling**: Never use hardcoded pixel values - always use `scale()`, `moderateScale()`, `verticalScale()`
3. **Component Structure**: Separate styles into `.styles.ts` files
4. **Backend**: Use `../../backend/convex/` for all operations, never `convex_archived/`
5. **Payment Flow**: Submit-first-pay-later pattern with Maya integration

### Project State:
- **Architecture**: Feature-Slice Design v2 with 8 layers
- **Payment**: Maya integration complete with webhooks
- **UI Components**: Standardized with responsive design
- **Current Focus**: Updating remaining application step components

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks:
1. Update UploadDocumentsStep component to match master project
2. Update MedicalExaminationStep component
3. Update ReviewApplicationStep component
4. Complete PaymentStep integration improvements

### Documentation Maintenance:
- Keep CLAUDE.md files updated with any architectural changes
- Document new patterns as they emerge
- Update troubleshooting section with new issues/solutions

## Impact

These documentation updates ensure:
- **Consistency**: All future development follows established patterns
- **Onboarding**: New developers/AI agents can quickly understand the project
- **Quality**: Clear guidelines prevent common mistakes
- **Efficiency**: Comprehensive examples reduce implementation time
