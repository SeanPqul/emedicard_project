## üß™ Automated Testing

Run these commands in `apps/webadmin`:

- [ ] `npm test -- attendance-tracker` (All tests pass)
- [ ] `npm test -- attendance-tracker --coverage` (Check coverage %)

## üìã Core Business Logic Tests

### FINISHED Status (Completed Orientation)

- [ ] Applicant has both check-in AND check-out times
- [ ] Status badge shows "Completed" (green)

Check these after finalizing a session:

- [ ] `orientations` table: status updated correctly
- [ ] `applications` table: status changed to "Approved" or "For Orientation"
- [ ] `notifications` table: notifications sent to applicants
- [ ] `adminActivityLogs` table: finalization logged

### Test Data Scenarios

Create these test cases:

1. **All Completed** - 5 applicants, all check in + check out
   - [ ] All show "Completed" badge
   - [ ] Finalize ‚Üí all become "Approved"

2. **All Missed** - 5 applicants, none check in
   - [ ] All show "Scheduled" badge
   - [ ] Finalize ‚Üí all stay "For Orientation"

3. **Mixed Statuses** - 2 completed, 2 missed, 1 excused
   - [ ] Each shows correct badge
   - [ ] Finalize ‚Üí correct counts in alert

4. **Partial Attendance** - Check in only, no check out
   - [ ] Shows "‚è≥ Checked In (time)"
   - [ ] Finalize ‚Üí treated as "Missed"
