# Document Rejection History System - Implementation Handoff

## üìã Executive Summary
This handoff document details the completion of **Phase 1** of the Document Rejection History System implementation. The backend infrastructure is now fully operational and ready for frontend development.

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Branch**: `document-rejection-history`  
**Progress**: Phase 1 Complete (25/95 tasks - 26.3% overall)

---

## üéØ Project Context

### What is Being Built
A comprehensive document rejection audit trail system that:
- Preserves all rejected documents permanently for audit purposes
- Tracks rejection reasons and specific issues
- Allows users to resubmit corrected documents
- Maintains complete history of all rejection attempts
- Updates application status automatically based on document states

### Why This is Important
- **Compliance**: Maintains audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback on why documents were rejected
- **Efficiency**: Reduces support tickets by providing self-service resubmission
- **Data Integrity**: Never loses rejected documents or history

---

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Completed (Phase 1)

### 1. Feature Branch Setup
```bash
Branch: document-rejection-history
Status: Created and pushed to origin
Remote: https://github.com/SeanPqul/emedicard_project.git
```

### 2. Database Schema Updates
**Location**: `backend/convex/schema.ts`

#### New Table Added: `documentRejectionHistory`
```typescript
- applicationId: Reference to application
- documentTypeId: Type of document rejected
- documentUploadId: Original upload reference
- rejectedFileId: Preserved file in storage (never deleted)
- originalFileName: Name of rejected file
- fileSize: Size in bytes
- fileType: MIME type
- rejectionCategory: Enum (quality_issue, wrong_document, etc.)
- rejectionReason: Detailed text explanation
- specificIssues: Array of specific problems
- rejectedBy: Admin/inspector who rejected
- rejectedAt: Timestamp
- wasReplaced: Boolean flag
- replacementUploadId: Link to new upload
- replacedAt: When replaced
- attemptNumber: Tracks 1st, 2nd, 3rd attempts
```

#### Application Status Enum Updated
Added new statuses:
- `"Documents Need Revision"` - Main status for rejected documents
- `"For Document Verification"`
- `"For Orientation"`
- `"Pending"`
- `"Cancelled"`

### 3. Backend Mutations Implemented

#### `backend/convex/admin/documents/rejectDocument.ts`
**Purpose**: Allows admins/inspectors to reject documents
**Key Features**:
- Permission checking (admin/inspector only)
- Creates rejection history record
- Updates document status to "Rejected"
- Changes application status to "Documents Need Revision"
- Sends notification to user
- Tracks attempt number

#### `backend/convex/requirements/resubmitDocument.ts`
**Purpose**: Allows users to resubmit rejected documents
**Key Features**:
- Verifies user ownership
- Links to rejection history
- Updates existing document upload
- Marks rejection as replaced
- Updates application status if all documents resolved
- Notifies admins of resubmission

### 4. Backend Queries Implemented

#### `backend/convex/documents/rejectionQueries.ts`
Contains four queries:

1. **getRejectionHistory** - Fetches all rejections for an application
2. **getDocumentRejectionDetails** - Detailed info for specific document
3. **getRejectedDocumentsCount** - Count for user badges
4. **getResubmissionQueue** - Admin view of pending resubmissions

### 5. Type Safety Fixes
Fixed type issues in multiple files to support new application statuses:
- `backend/convex/applications/updateApplication.ts`
- `backend/convex/applications/updateApplicationStatus.ts`
- `backend/convex/payments/maya/abandonedPayments.ts`

### 6. Documentation
- **Plan Document**: `apps/mobile/docs/DOCUMENT_REJECTION_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`
- **Progress**: Phase 1 checkboxes all marked complete (25/25 ‚úÖ)

## üöÄ Next Steps for Continuation

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Deploy Backend Changes**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx convex deploy
   ```
   This will deploy the schema and functions to the Convex backend.

2. **Test Backend Functions**
   - Open Convex dashboard
   - Test `rejectDocument` mutation with sample data
   - Test `resubmitDocument` mutation
   - Verify queries return expected data

### Phase 2: Frontend Types & Entities (0/12 tasks)
**Next implementation focus** - Create TypeScript types and entities for the frontend:

1. Navigate to mobile app: `cd apps/mobile`
2. Create rejection types in `src/entities/document/model/rejection-types.ts`
3. Define interfaces for `RejectionHistory`, `RejectionCategory`, `DocumentStatus`
4. Update existing document types to include rejection status
5. Create API wrapper functions

### Important Reminders

#### üî¥ CRITICAL: Update the Progress Tracker
**Location**: `apps/mobile/docs/DOCUMENT_REJECTION_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`

After completing ANY task, update the checkboxes:
- Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed tasks
- Update the progress counters (e.g., "Phase 2: Frontend Types & Entities (5/12)")
- Update overall progress counter at the top
- Commit changes with meaningful message

#### üü° Testing Requirements
Before moving to next phase:
- Run `pnpm typecheck` in backend directory
- Test all mutations in Convex dashboard
- Verify notifications are being created
- Check application status transitions

#### üü¢ Commit Strategy
Follow the established pattern:
```bash
# After each phase
git add .
git commit -m "feat(rejection-system): [Phase X] - Brief description"
git push origin document-rejection-history
```

## üìö Reference Information

### API Endpoints Created

#### Mutations
```typescript
// Admin rejects a document
api.admin.documents.rejectDocument({
  documentUploadId: "id",
  rejectionCategory: "quality_issue",
  rejectionReason: "Image is too blurry",
  specificIssues: ["Cannot read text", "Poor lighting"]
})

// User resubmits document
api.requirements.resubmitDocument({
  applicationId: "id",
  documentTypeId: "id",
  storageId: "id",
  fileName: "document.pdf",
  fileType: "application/pdf",
  fileSize: 1024000
})
```

#### Queries
```typescript
// Get rejection history
api.documents.rejectionQueries.getRejectionHistory({
  applicationId: "id"
})

// Get rejection details
api.documents.rejectionQueries.getDocumentRejectionDetails({
  applicationId: "id",
  documentTypeId: "id"
})

// Get rejected count
api.documents.rejectionQueries.getRejectedDocumentsCount({
  userId: "id"
})

// Admin: Get resubmission queue
api.documents.rejectionQueries.getResubmissionQueue()
```

### Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Audit Trail**: Rejected files are NEVER deleted, only marked as replaced
2. **Attempt Tracking**: Each rejection increments attempt number
3. **Status Flow**: "Documents Need Revision" ‚Üî "Submitted"/"Under Review"
4. **Notifications**: Both user and admin notifications implemented
5. **Permissions**: Admin/inspector only for rejection, user-owned for resubmission

### Potential Issues to Watch

1. **File Size**: Currently hardcoded as 0 in rejectDocument.ts (line 80)
   - Need to either get from storage or add to documentUploads table
   
2. **File Type**: Currently defaulted to "application/pdf" (line 81)
   - Should be stored in documentUploads for accuracy

3. **IP/UserAgent**: Currently undefined in rejection history
   - Consider adding these for better audit trail
