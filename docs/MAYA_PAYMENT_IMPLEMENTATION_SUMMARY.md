# Maya Payment Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a complete Maya payment integration with proper redirect handling for the "Back to Merchant" button and automatic payment status updates.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Payment Redirect Handler (`/payment-redirect`)
- **Location**: `backend/convex/http.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles redirects from Maya after payment completion/cancellation
- **Features**:
  - Validates required parameters (status, paymentId, applicationId)
  - Updates payment status automatically based on redirect status
  - Returns HTML that auto-redirects to mobile app
  - Provides fallback "Continue to App" button
  - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error pages

### 2. Updated Checkout Creation
- **Location**: `backend/convex/payments/maya/checkout.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Redirect URLs now point to Convex HTTP endpoints instead of direct deep links
  - Creates placeholder payment record first to include paymentId in redirect URLs
  - Prevents premature application status updates on failed checkouts
  - Automatic cleanup of failed payment records

### 3. Payment Status Management
- **Processing → Complete Flow**:
  1. Payment created with "Processing" status
  2. User completes payment in Maya
  3. Maya redirects to `/payment-redirect?status=success`
  4. Handler calls `syncPaymentStatus` to verify with Maya API
  5. Status updates to "Complete" if payment confirmed

### 4. Error Handling
- **Implemented Safeguards**:
  - Parameter validation with user-friendly error pages
  - Graceful handling of network failures
  - Logging of all redirect attempts
  - Continue operation even if status update fails

## How It Works

### Payment Flow:
```
1. User initiates payment → Maya checkout created
2. User pays in Maya → Maya shows "Back to Merchant" button
3. User clicks button → Redirects to: https://your-app.convex.site/payment-redirect?status=xxx
4. Convex handler:
   - Updates payment status
   - Returns HTML with auto-redirect
   - Shows manual button if auto-redirect fails
5. Mobile app receives: emedicardproject://payment/[status]?paymentId=xxx&applicationId=yyy
6. Payment status synced and displayed
```

## Environment Setup Required

### 1. Set Environment Variables
```env
# In .env.local
CONVEX_URL=https://your-project-name.convex.site
MAYA_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
MAYA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
MAYA_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
```

### 2. Configure Maya Dashboard
- Add webhook URL: `https://your-project-name.convex.site/maya-webhook`
- Add allowed redirect URL: `https://your-project-name.convex.site/payment-redirect`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Create a payment**:
   - Initiate payment from mobile app
   - Complete payment in Maya sandbox
   - Click "Back to Merchant"
   - Verify redirect to mobile app
   - Check payment status updates to "Complete"

2. **Test cancellation**:
   - Start payment process
   - Click "Back to Merchant" without paying
   - Verify status remains "Processing" or updates to "Cancelled"

3. **Test error scenarios**:
   - Try accessing redirect URL with missing parameters
   - Test with invalid payment IDs
   - Verify error pages display correctly

## Key Benefits

1. **Seamless User Experience**: Users can return to app via "Back to Merchant" button
2. **Automatic Status Updates**: Payment status syncs when user returns
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of all edge cases
4. **Security**: All redirects validated and logged
5. **Mobile-First**: Works with both iOS and Android deep links

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Status Stuck on "Processing"
1. Check if webhook is configured in Maya dashboard
2. Verify user clicked through redirect (not closing browser)
3. Check payment logs for sync attempts
4. Manually call `syncPaymentStatus` if needed

### "Back to Merchant" Not Working
1. Verify `CONVEX_URL` is set correctly
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Test manual "Continue to App" button
4. Ensure mobile app is installed and deep links configured

### Deep Links Not Opening App
1. Verify app is configured for `emedicardproject://` scheme
2. Test deep links directly in browser
3. Check if app is installed on device
4. Try manual redirect button

## Next Steps
- Monitor payment logs for any issues
- Consider adding analytics for redirect success rates
- Implement retry mechanism for failed status syncs
- Add support for payment receipt downloads
