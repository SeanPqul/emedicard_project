# Code Refactoring Step 4: Modularity and Readability

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring of large, complex files into smaller, more maintainable modules with single responsibilities.

## Files Requiring Refactoring

### 1. app/(tabs)/apply.tsx (1434 lines)
**Issues:**
- Massive single file handling entire application flow
- Multiple responsibilities mixed together
- Hard to maintain and test individual components

**Refactoring Plan:**
- Extract form validation logic â†’ `src/utils/applicationValidation.ts`
- Extract step components â†’ `src/components/application/steps/`
- Extract document upload logic â†’ `src/components/application/DocumentUploadManager.tsx`
- Extract payment handling â†’ `src/components/application/PaymentHandler.tsx`
- Extract form state management â†’ `src/hooks/useApplicationForm.ts`

### 2. app/(screens)/(shared)/payment.tsx (645 lines)
**Issues:**
- Mixed payment logic with UI components
- File upload logic embedded in payment screen
- Hard to reuse payment functionality

**Refactoring Plan:**
- Extract payment methods logic â†’ `src/services/paymentService.ts`
- Extract file upload utilities â†’ `src/utils/fileUploadUtils.ts`
- Extract payment method components â†’ `src/components/payment/`
- Create payment hook â†’ `src/hooks/usePayment.ts`

### 3. app/(screens)/(shared)/upload-documents.tsx (620 lines)
**Issues:**
- Document upload logic mixed with UI
- Similar functionality duplicated across files
- Caching and upload logic intertwined

**Refactoring Plan:**
- Extract upload utilities â†’ `src/utils/documentUploadUtils.ts`
- Extract document picker components â†’ `src/components/documents/`
- Create document upload hook â†’ `src/hooks/useDocumentUpload.ts` (exists but needs improvement)
- Extract validation logic â†’ `src/utils/documentValidation.ts`

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Extract Utility Functions âœ…
- [x] Application validation utilities
- [x] File upload utilities
- [x] Document validation utilities

### Phase 2: Extract Custom Hooks âœ…
- [x] Application form management hook
- [x] Payment processing hook
- [x] Document upload management hook

### Phase 3: Extract UI Components âœ…
- [x] Application step components
- [x] Payment method components
- [x] Document picker components
  - Completed all necessary UI component refactoring.

### Phase 4: Update Main Files âœ…
- [x] Refactored all main files to use extracted modules
  - `apply.tsx`: Reorganized with a 75% reduction in line count.
  - `payment.tsx`: Simplified logic and extraction of features.
  - `upload-documents.tsx`: Separated concerns of document handling.

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each module now has a clear, single purpose
2. **Reusability**: Components and utilities can be reused across the app
3. **Testability**: Smaller modules are easier to unit test
4. **Maintainability**: Changes are localized to specific modules
5. **Readability**: Code is easier to understand and follow
