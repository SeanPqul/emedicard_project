# Payment Rejection System - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. Database Schema
**File:** `backend/convex/schema.ts`
- Added `paymentRejectionHistory` table (similar to `documentRejectionHistory`)
- Tracks: category, reason, specific issues, attempt number, resubmission status
- 8 rejection categories: invalid_receipt, wrong_amount, unclear_receipt, expired_receipt, duplicate_payment, wrong_account, incomplete_info, other

### 2. Admin UI - Rejection Modal
**File:** `apps/webadmin/src/app/dashboard/[id]/payment_validation/page.tsx`
- Detailed rejection modal with:
  - Category dropdown
  - Reason textarea (required)
  - Specific issues list (optional, can add multiple)
  - Form validation
- Beautiful, user-friendly interface

### 3. Backend Mutations & Queries

#### `rejectPayment` Mutation
**File:** `backend/convex/admin/payments/rejectPayment.ts`
- Creates rejection history record
- Updates payment & application status
- Sends notification to applicant
- Tracks attempt numbers automatically

#### `resubmitPayment` Mutation  
**File:** `backend/convex/payments/resubmitPayment.ts`
- For mobile side to call when user resubmits
- Marks old rejection as replaced
- Links new payment to history
- Notifies admin

#### `getAllRejections` Query
**File:** `backend/convex/admin/rejectionHistory.ts`
- Now includes payment rejections
- Shows in unified rejection history dashboard
- Filters by admin's managed categories

#### `getRejectionStats` Query
**File:** Same as above
- Statistics updated to include payment rejections

## How to Test üß™

### Admin Side (Web)
1. Go to payment validation page for an application
2. Click "Reject Payment" button
3. Select category (e.g., "Unclear Receipt")
4. Enter reason: "The receipt image is too blurry to read the reference number"
5. Optionally add specific issues:
   - Click "Add" to add issues like "Reference number not visible"
   - "Date is unclear"
6. Click "Confirm Rejection"
7. Check:
   - Success message appears
   - Redirected to dashboard
   - Go to "Rejection History" ‚Üí see the payment rejection with purple "Payment" badge

### View Rejection History
1. Navigate to Dashboard ‚Üí Rejection History
2. Use filter: Type ‚Üí "Payment"
3. See payment rejection with:
   - Type: Payment (purple badge)
   - Document Type: "Payment Receipt"
   - Category and reason
   - Status: "Pending" or "Resubmitted"

## For Your Leader (Mobile Side) üì±

### What Your Leader Needs to Do

The backend is **100% ready**. Your leader needs to create the mobile UI to:

#### 1. **Display Rejection to User**
When application status is "Payment Rejected":
- Show rejection category (e.g., "Unclear Receipt")
- Show detailed reason
- Show specific issues (if any)
- Show attempt number (e.g., "Attempt 2")

**API to use:**
```typescript
const rejections = useQuery(api.admin.rejectionHistory.getAllRejections, {});
const paymentRejection = rejections?.find(
  r => r.type === "payment" && 
       r.applicationId === currentAppId && 
       !r.wasReplaced
);
```

#### 2. **Add Resubmit Button**
When user taps "Resubmit Payment":
- Let user upload new receipt
- Create new payment record
- Call the resubmission API

**API to call:**
```typescript
const resubmitPayment = useMutation(api.payments.resubmitPayment.resubmitPayment);

await resubmitPayment({
  applicationId: appId,
  oldPaymentId: rejectedPaymentId,
  newPaymentId: newlyCreatedPaymentId
});
```

#### 3. **Handle Notification**
When user receives `payment_rejected` notification:
- Navigate to rejection details screen
- Or show inline in application screen
