# Attendance Tracker Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored the Yellow Card Admin's Attendance Tracker feature to improve the final validation process for orientation attendance.

## Date: 2025-10-27

---

## Backend Changes

### 1. **Updated Query Filter - Only Finished Sessions** (`backend/convex/orientations/attendance.ts`)
- Modified `getOrientationSchedulesForDate` query to filter and show only sessions that have ended
- Uses `isSessionPast()` helper to check if session end time has passed
- This ensures admins can only finalize sessions that have actually finished

### 2. **New Mutation: Manual Status Update** (`backend/convex/orientations/attendance.ts`)
- Added `manuallyUpdateAttendanceStatus` mutation
- Allows Yellow Card admins to manually mark attendees as:
  - **Completed**: Automatically sets check-in/check-out times if missing
  - **Excused**: For attendees with valid reasons
  - **Missed**: For no-shows
- Includes optional admin notes field
- Logs all manual status changes in admin activity log
- Updates application status to "Attendance Validation" when marked as Completed

---

## Frontend Changes

### 1. **Time Slot Dropdown Filter**
- Added dropdown to filter schedules by specific time slots
- Dynamically populated based on available schedules for selected date
- "All Time Slots" option to view everything
- Resets when date changes

### 2. **Gender Column Added**
- Added "Gender" column to attendees table
- Displays gender information from user/application data

### 3. **Search Functionality**
- Added search bar for each session
- Real-time filtering of attendees by name
- Search is session-specific (independent for each schedule)

### 4. **Manual Status Override UI**
- Added "Edit Status" button for each attendee
- Opens modal dialog with:
  - Status dropdown (Completed, Excused, Missed)
  - Admin notes textarea
  - Cancel and Update buttons
- Pre-fills current status and existing notes
- Shows inspector notes inline in the table

### 5. **Enhanced Status Badge**
- Added "Excused" status badge (yellow)
- Updated status types to include 'Excused'

### 6. **Improved Empty States**
- Better messaging when no finished sessions found
- Clarifies that only ended sessions can be finalized
- Added filter-specific empty state message

### 7. **Enhanced Attendee Display**
- Shows inspector/admin notes below attendee name (if present)
- Action column with "Edit Status" button
- Maintains check-in/check-out time display

## Key Features

### ✅ Date Filter
- Select specific date to view finished sessions

### ✅ Time Slot Filter
- Dropdown to filter by specific time slots
- Shows all available time slots for the selected date

### ✅ Session Display
- Only shows sessions that have ended (validation rule)
- Displays session info: time, venue, instructor
- Shows stats: checked in count, completed count, pending count

### ✅ Attendee Search
- Search attendees by name within each session
- Real-time filtering

### ✅ Attendee Information
- Name with notes display
- Gender column
- Job category with color coding
- Status badge (Scheduled, Completed, Missed, Excused)
- Attendance status (check-in/check-out times)

### ✅ Manual Status Override
- Admin can manually update any attendee's status
- Add notes for record keeping
- Useful for handling excused absences or manual validation

### ✅ Finalize Session
- Batch process all attendees in a session
- Completed → Approved (ready for health card)
- Missed → For Orientation (can rebook)
- Excused → Keep current status (manual handling)
- Shows summary of results (completed, missed, excused counts)

---

## Validation Rules

1. **Only Finished Sessions**: Admin can only see and finalize sessions where the end time has passed
2. **Manual Override Available**: Admin can manually mark status before finalization
3. **Finalization Logic**:
   - Attendees with check-in + check-out + status "Completed" → Approved
   - Attendees marked as "Excused" → Keep current status
   - Attendees without proper attendance → Missed (sent back to "For Orientation")

---

## Data Flow

1. **Date Selection** → Filters schedules by date
2. **Backend Filter** → Only returns finished sessions
3. **Time Slot Filter** → Further filters schedules by selected time slot
4. **Display Sessions** → Shows all matching sessions with attendees
5. **Search Attendees** → Filter attendees within each session
6. **Manual Status Update** → Admin can override individual status
7. **Finalize Session** → Batch process all attendees, update application statuses

---

## Technical Details

### Backend Query
- Table: `orientationSchedules` (joined with `orientations`, `applications`, `users`, `jobCategories`)
- Index: `by_date` on orientationSchedules
- Index: `by_date_timeslot_venue` on orientations
- Filters: Session must be past (end time < current time)

### Frontend State Management
- `selectedDate`: Date picker state
- `selectedTimeSlot`: Time slot dropdown state ('all' or specific time)
- `searchQuery`: Object mapping scheduleId to search string
- `editingAttendee`: Modal state for status update
- `statusUpdateForm`: Form state for status and notes

### Mutations Used
- `finalizeSessionAttendance`: Batch finalize all attendees
- `manuallyUpdateAttendanceStatus`: Individual status override

## Testing Recommendations

1. ✅ Test date selection with past, present, and future dates
2. ✅ Test time slot filtering with multiple schedules
3. ✅ Test search functionality with various names
4. ✅ Test manual status update for each status type
5. ✅ Test finalization with mixed attendance statuses
6. ✅ Verify only finished sessions appear
7. ✅ Verify gender column displays correctly
8. ✅ Verify admin notes persist and display
