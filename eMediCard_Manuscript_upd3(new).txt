      This study presents eMediCard, a mobile-based health card management system designed to modernize the health card registration and renewal process for employees in Davao City. Currently, thousands of workers must physically visit designated venues during peak months, resulting in severe overcrowding with over 1,400 daily applicants and work disruptions. The manual system also imposes heavy administrative burdens on the City Health Office (CHO), leading to processing delays.
      Using the Waterfall Model, the development team conducted requirements gathering through interviews with CHO personnel and applicants, followed by systematic design and implementation. The system was built using React Native with Expo framework, Convex as the serverless database, Clerk for authentication, and integrated with Maya payment gateway.
      The mobile application enables users to register, submit medical documents, and select their classification (Yellow for food handlers, Green for non-food workers, Pink for skin-contact occupations). Yellow card applicants can schedule mandatory food safety orientations. Upon approval, users download digital health cards embedded with QR codes. CHO administrators use a web-based dashboard to validate documents and generate reports, successfully reducing physical congestion and improving data accuracy.

INTRODUCTION
Project Context
      The rapid growth of mobile application development has transformed industries such as retail, healthcare, and government by offering fast and convenient access to services. In the healthcare sector, mobile platforms have enhanced communication, streamlined data management, and improved service delivery. Successful digital initiatives, like Ghana's National Health Insurance and Propel's Medicaid renewal campaign, show how mobile systems reduce waiting times, cut administrative burdens, and improve overall user satisfaction.
      In Davao City, the current health card renewal process is entirely manual. Every year, especially in January, thousands of employees must line up at designated venues, resulting in long queues, overcrowding, and delays that disrupt work schedules. While efforts have been made to improve accessibility through social media, these platforms often suffer from misinformation, duplication, and data security issues.
      Davao's economic growth and expanding workforce have further intensified the need for a more efficient renewal system. With increasing demand from sectors like tourism, infrastructure, and BPO, it's essential to modernize this process to keep up with compliance and public health regulations.
      To address these issues, our team proposes eMediCard, a mobile-based application that digitizes the entire health card registration and renewal process. Through the app, employees can submit personal information, upload required medical documents, track their status, and receive their digital health cards, all from their smartphones. CHO administrators are also provided with tools to validate submissions, manage orientations, and issue approvals. This system aims to reduce congestion, shorten processing times, and make the health card renewal process more secure and efficient for all.
Purpose and Description
      The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application that facilitates the registration and annual renewal of health cards for employees in Davao City. Currently, the process requires thousands of employees to visit designated venues each January, where they undergo health evaluations and update their records. This traditional method often leads to overcrowding, long queues, and delays that disrupt work schedules. It also places a heavy administrative burden on the City Health Office (CHO), resulting in missed deadlines and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this project aims to replace the conventional in-person system with a mobile-based solution accessible directly from employees' smartphones.
      The proposed application will enable users to register and submit necessary information, including personal details and medical documents, such as chest X-ray, CBC, urinalysis, fecalysis, drug test, neuropsychiatric test, Hepatitis B antibody test, valid ID, Community Tax Certificate, health card receipt (OR), and a 1x1 picture. The system is designed with an intuitive interface to support users with varying levels of digital literacy. It also integrates payment options, allowing users to pay through in-app platforms such as Maya or submit proof of payment from designated physical locations. A ?10 transaction fee will automatically be added to the total amount during each payment to cover administrative or processing costs.
      Applicants will identify whether they are food or non-food workers through a classification system that assigns color-coded health card types: Yellow for food handlers (e.g., service crew, kitchen staff), Green for non-food industry workers (e.g., security guards, receptionists, BPO staff), and Pink for occupations involving direct skin contact (e.g., barbers, massage therapists, tattoo artists). Food handlers will be required to attend a mandatory food safety orientation with a sanitary inspector and they will receive a schedule appointment. Non-food and pink card applicants may proceed directly with the process unless otherwise instructed.
      To enhance transparency, the app provides real-time status updates and notifications to inform applicants about their progress, missing requirements, or next steps. If an applicant is disapproved, often due to incomplete documents or medical findings, the system will display a personalized follow-up checklist, suggest nearby health centers, and guide them through the additional tests needed before they can reapply.
      Once the user's application is approved, they will be notified that their digital health card is available for download within the app. The card will display essential details such as the user's name, assigned classification color, photo, and expiration date. To enhance security and protect against forgery, each digital health card will be embedded with a system-generated QR code. This QR code stores key information and can be scanned by authorized City Health Office personnel or affiliated organizations to confirm the card's validity. This ensures a safe, contactless, and reliable method for verifying health card authenticity during inspections or job-related evaluations.
      Overall, the eMediCard mobile application is envisioned as a comprehensive solution to improve the efficiency, security, and accessibility of the health card renewal process in Davao City. The system will be managed by both applicants and City Health Office (CHO) administrators. Applicants can register, submit requirements, track their status, and receive notifications. Administrators will be able to verify documents, manage compliance, send updates, and generate reports for monitoring and future improvements.

      This project is primarily a mobile-based application, meaning that its core functionality is designed for mobile platforms. However, a web-based version has been introduced exclusively for admin use. For now, the application is specifically developed for Android devices only, and does not currently support iOS or other operating systems. The system is specifically tailored for the health card renewal process in Davao City, designed to meet local administrative practices and regulatory requirements, which may not be readily adaptable to other regions without substantial modifications. Although the application incorporates advanced features such as secure digital document uploads, real-time status updates, and mandatory food safety orientation, it relies on users having a basic level of digital literacy and stable internet access. The system requires stable internet connectivity for real-time database synchronization through Convex and authentication through Clerk. Additionally, certain processes such as the physical verification of documents may still require manual intervention, potentially causing delays in processing.
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE/STUDIES/SYSTEMS
Related Studies and/or Systems
Mobile Health Card Application System (Itransition, 2024)
      The research conducted by Itransition (2024) was to design a mobile health card application system through which the patients can retrieve their medical information, book appointments, and converse with healthcare providers. The system is integrated with IoT and wearables to remotely capture health information securely and make healthcare services better. Based on Itransition (2024), the major issue in conventional healthcare systems is the insufficient availability of effective medical record access. Patients find it difficult to deal with paperwork and scheduling appointments manually, which causes inefficiencies and delays in medical treatment. With the processes being digitized, the mobile health card application provides a smooth flow of data access and management.
      The system allows for quicker and more streamlined healthcare procedures, enabling users to keep and retrieve their health records online. Patients can book appointments with healthcare providers, get reminders about appointments, and monitor their medical history in one platform. Furthermore, integration with wearable devices provides real-time monitoring of health conditions, encouraging active healthcare management.
      The patient has access to the login and registration page, where he or she may modify his or her medical history, view appointment schedules, and obtain personalized health information. Health providers, on the other hand, can securely manage patient information, monitor health trends, and streamline medical workflows.


Health Solutions for Digital Healthcare (OSP Labs, 2023)
      In the research conducted by OSP Labs (2023), mHealth solutions were created to make healthcare services easily accessible and convenient through online platforms. They are comprised of mobile apps, wearables, and remote monitoring equipment that was developed to help patients monitor their health, meet with medical professionals, and implement wellness plans.  As per OSP Labs (2023), the main challenge in healthcare is the accessibility gap, particularly among patients in rural regions. Integrating mHealth solutions helps bridge this gap by providing telemedicine consultations, medication reminders, and real-time health monitoring capabilities. 
      The mHealth platform increases efficiency through the digitization of scheduling appointments, prescribing electronically, and virtual consultations. The app enables patients to schedule appointments, access health alerts, and securely share medical reports with healthcare professionals. The use of AI-powered analytics also helps to identify early disease symptoms, and timely medical interventions are ensured. 
      Administrators and care providers can equally gain from the system as they can monitor patient records, derive trends from health data, and enhance the provision of healthcare by means of targeted treatment plans. The digitization of healthcare services via mHealth applications aids better patient involvement as well as medical outcomes.

Mobile Health Regulations and Compliance (Federal Trade Commission, 2023)
      The Federal Trade Commission (2023) performed a study on regulatory compliance in mobile health apps. The study highlights that while online healthcare platforms are of many benefits, they have to follow rigorous privacy, security, and data protection rules to uphold patient trust and confidentiality.  As per the FTC (2023), most of the healthcare apps are subject to legal and ethical issues surrounding data security. If there are no proper compliance practices, there are chances of leaking sensitive health data, and that is highly detrimental to both patients and healthcare professionals. 
      In response to these challenges, the FTC launched an interactive guide to assist developers in complying with privacy legislation like HIPAA and GDPR. The guide assists mobile health developers in ensuring their apps are up to standard security levels, securing patient information from improper access. Through compliance regulations, healthcare apps can strengthen data security, win the trust of patients, and legally conduct business in the digital health market. Adhering to stringent cybersecurity protocols is essential for long-term success and acceptance of mobile health technology.


Synthesis
      The review of related studies and systems emphasize the transformative potential of mobile health technologies in modernizing healthcare services, enhancing patient accessibility, and ensuring regulatory compliance. The Mobile Health Card Application System (Itransition, 2024) addresses inefficiencies in conventional healthcare systems by digitizing medical record access, appointment scheduling, and real-time health monitoring through IoT and wearable integration. Similarly, mHealth Solutions for Digital Healthcare (OSP Labs, 2023) highlight the role of mobile applications in bridging healthcare accessibility gaps, particularly in rural areas. By incorporating telemedicine, AI-powered analytics, and remote health monitoring, these solutions enhance efficiency and patient engagement while streamlining medical workflows.
      However, with the growing reliance on digital health platforms, regulatory compliance and data security remain critical challenges. The Federal Trade Commission (2023) underscores the importance of adhering to privacy regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR to protect sensitive patient information. The study highlights the risks associated with improper compliance and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to prevent data breaches. Ensuring that mobile health applications meet legal and ethical standards is crucial for gaining patient trust and promoting widespread adoption of digital healthcare solutions.
      These findings align with the objectives of eMediCard: A Mobile-Based Health Card Application System, which aims to facilitate health card applications, reduce processing time, and minimize overcrowding in government offices. Inspired by Itransition's mobile health card system, eMediCard seeks to provide a secure and user-friendly digital platform for health record access and appointment management. Additionally, the concerns raised by the FTC study emphasize the need for strong data security protocols, ensuring patient information is safeguarded against unauthorized access. By addressing these challenges, eMediCard can contribute to the modernization of healthcare services in the Philippines, making medical processes more efficient, secure, and accessible for all citizen
METHODOLOGY
Technical Background
Technologies to be Used 
      The eMediCard system will use a set of open-source technologies chosen for their ease of use, speed of development, and reliable performance. React Native using the Expo framework will serve as the primary technology for building the eMediCard mobile application. Expo is an open-source framework that simplifies the React Native development workflow by providing built-in tools for app configuration, testing, and deployment. It enables faster testing via the Expo Go app, which allows developers to preview the app on real devices instantly without manual builds. The framework also integrates Expo Application Services (EAS) for automated building and publishing of Android applications. React Native allows developers to write JavaScript and JSX code that compiles into native Android components, ensuring smooth performance and a consistent user experience across devices.
      For writing and debugging the eMediCard application, Visual Studio Code is primarily used as a lightweight and customizable code editor that supports various extensions for React Native and Expo development. The Expo Go app is also utilized for testing, allowing the application to be previewed and tested on real Android devices instantly without requiring manual builds. This setup makes development faster and more efficient, enabling developers to identify and resolve issues quickly while maintaining smooth coordination throughout the development process.
Database Methodology
      The eMediCard backend utilizes Convex, a real-time and serverless database platform, for all persistent data management. Convex provides a structured schema through tables that store user profiles, application records, documents, payments information, and orientation schedules. Its built-in reactive queries ensure that updates such as document approvals or payment confirmations are reflected instantly in the mobile application without requiring manual refresh or polling. During development, a dedicated Convex deployment environment is used to simulate data interactions and validate function permissions before production releases. This setup ensures data consistency, security and scalability while reducing the need for complex backend maintenance.
Authentication
      The eMediCard mobile application implements user authentication and account management through Clerk, a secure identity platform designed for modern web and mobile applications. Clerk handles essential features such as user registration, login, and session management, while supporting both email and social authentication methods. It integrates seamlessly with Convex, ensuring that only authorized users can access, modify, or submit data within the system. This setup simplifies user management, enhances security, and provides a reliable framework for protecting sensitive personal and medical information.
Storage / File Uploads
      The system manages file uploads through Convex's built-in file storage feature, which securely handles the submission and retrieval of user documents such as medical test results, proof of payment, and identification files. Uploaded files are stored in an encrypted environment to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive health-related data. Each uploaded document is linked to the corresponding user record in the Convex database, maintaining data consistency across the system. This setup allows administrators to easily access and verify submitted documents while ensuring that files remain protected from unauthorized access or alteration.
Software Development Approach (Waterfall Model)
      The development of the eMediCard mobile application follows a Modified Waterfall Model, a structured, phase-oriented methodology that progresses sequentially through Requirements Gathering, System Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Unlike the traditional rigid Waterfall approach, this modified version allows for limited revisiting of earlier phases when critical issues are discovered, while maintaining well-defined deliverables and validation checkpoints before advancing to the next stage. This method promotes strong planning, documentation, and traceability, supporting the secure handling of sensitive health data and ensuring alignment with the regulatory standards of the City Health Office. Refer to Page 62, Figure 2.
      In this development cycle, the team concentrated on the early stages of the Waterfall process, specifically the Requirements Analysis and Design Phases. During requirements analysis, all key system functionalities were identified and documented in accordance with the actual workflow of health card issuance. These include user registration, classification-based document submission, payment processing, and orientation scheduling. The requirements were validated through field research and stakeholder interviews to ensure accuracy and relevance.
      Following this, the Design Phase involved the formulation of system architecture, database schema, and user interface prototypes. Tools such as Figma were used to create interactive mockups that demonstrate how users will navigate the application, from submitting applications to viewing their orientation schedules. These visual artifacts serve as the technical foundation for the upcoming Implementation Phase.
      During the Implementation Phase, the approved design assets, database schemas, and API definitions are translated into working React Native code using the Expo framework. The project is configured in Visual Studio Code, where modules are built according to the system's functional requirements. Integration begins with Clerk, which manages authentication and user sessions, followed by the implementation of Convex backend functions for handling data storage, document management, and real-time updates. The application configuration is managed through Expo's app.json file, which defines metadata, permissions, and build settings.
      Each system feature-such as user registration, document uploads, payment processing, notification handling, and digital card generation-is implemented as an independent module to ensure maintainability and scalability. Development follows version control practices using Git, with code changes tracked and reviewed to maintain quality. Throughout implementation, Convex function permissions and authentication checks are defined to ensure that data access is secure and limited to authorized users. This structured approach enables efficient development while maintaining a high level of security and code quality.
      During the Testing Phase, the developers and QA testers jointly verify functionality, usability, performance, and security. Automated integration tests run through critical flows, including signup, document submission and approval, orientation scheduling, and card release, using the Convex development deployment for testing. Manual testing on various Android devices catches UI and edge-case issues (e.g., upload interruptions, low bandwidth), while security checks challenge authentication and Convex function permissions. Defects are tracked, prioritized, and resolved systematically, followed by an acceptance test with City Health Office stakeholders to ensure compliance with real-world workflows and regulations.
      In the Deployment Phase, the developers assemble a signed, release-mode Android App Bundle (AAB) using Expo Application Services (EAS) Build for building production apps, including screenshots, metadata, release notes, and a privacy policy. An initial beta rollout to CHO staff and selected users surfaces any critical issues before full production release. After successful beta feedback, the build moves to production. Post-release, monitoring tools track app health and usage, and a rollback plan allows swift reversion to the previous stable version if necessary.
      Finally, in the Maintenance Phase, developers and QA testers continuously monitor the live application for bugs, performance issues, and user feedback. They review updates to Convex schema and functions regularly to identify crash trends or usability issues. Critical defects are addressed immediately through hotfix deployments, while minor updates and new feature requests are grouped into subsequent update cycles. Security patches, such as Clerk configuration updates and Expo SDK updates, are applied as soon as vulnerabilities are discovered.

Requirements Gathering and Analysis
      The requirements gathering for the eMediCard mobile application was conducted from the first to second week of March 2025, following formal approval through an interview request letter submitted to the City Health Office (CHO). The initial phase began with a structured interview with CHO staff members who oversee health card operations at the designated processing venue in Victoria Plaza. The interview provided the team with valuable insights into the end-to-end workflow of health card registration and renewal, along with common issues faced by both applicants and CHO personnel. Their broad operational knowledge enabled the team to understand the administrative routines, processing challenges, and compliance concerns that a digital system must address.
      To facilitate comprehensive requirement capture, the team prepared interview questions covering current workflow processes, operational challenges, documentation requirements, and technology needs. During the interview, CHO staff provided a detailed flowchart illustrating the existing health card issuance process, which served as a critical reference for understanding the sequential steps from application submission to card release. According to City Health Office (CHO) records, renewal numbers surged during the first quarter of 2024, with 23,489 applicants in January, 29,185 in February, and 18,788 in March. These peak months accounted for over 71,000 health card renewals in just three months. The high traffic volumes particularly in January and February, where daily applicants reached up to 1,400 highlighted the strain placed on the manual system and reinforced the urgent need for a scalable, digital solution capable of managing bulk renewals efficiently.
      To contextualize these findings within the local framework, the team conducted field interviews and consultations with CHO peronnel, health card applicants, and administrative staff involved in the current in-person process. These conversations provided essential insights into how applications were evaluated, what documents were typically submitted, and how orientations were scheduled and conducted-particularly for food industry workers who require a mandatory seminar.
      During the interview, the CHO staff member explained that when an applicant's submission is disapproved due to medical findings such as pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) or urinary tract infection (UTI), they are required to undergo a follow-up consultation with a physician. This additional check-up ensures applicants are medically cleared before continuing the health card process, which the app must accommodate through personalized feedback and follow-up guidance. This led the team to prioritize a user-friendly document submission interface capable of handling various file types while enabling administrators to flag missing or questionable entries. This reinforced the need for real-time status notifications and dynamic checklists within the app.
      The team also engaged several employees from two local businesses-McDonald's Buhangin Pagibig Branch and Three J Watch Service Center from Gaisano Grand Ilustre-who were frequent health card applicants. These users described the longest queue times as one of their main concerns during the renewal process, but noted that they clearly understood the difference between Yellow, Green, and Pink health card types. They explained that this information is included in the official paper provided during initial registration or renewal at the venue. However, they expressed frustration over the long waiting times during renewal, sharing that queues often extended outside the mall premises. Based on this, the team retained the classification system in the app but shifted focus toward enhancing user guidance, improving progress transparency, and introducing digital queuing features to reduce physical congestion.
      Another significant output of the analysis was the integration of payment functionality. Through feedback from both users and CHO finance staff, the team identified the importance of a flexible payment module that supports online methods through Maya payment gateway and manual uploads of official receipts from physical payment centers. A base ?10 transaction fee was included as a feature for processing and recordkeeping purposes.

Requirements Documentation
      This section outlines the mobile application's features and provides detailed descriptions aligned with the developers' specified objectives. The requirements were derived from comprehensive interviews with City Health Office personnel, field observations during peak renewal periods, and consultations with health card applicants at local establishments.
User Registration Module
      The user registration module serves as the entry point for applicants seeking to obtain or renew health cards. New users complete a secure registration process powered by Clerk authentication, providing a valid email address and password, followed by the upload of a verification document (e.g., Valid ID). The system verifies the email format and ensures the document is uploaded before account creation.. The system verifies email addresses through confirmation links to establish account ownership and prevent duplicates. User credentials are securely stored in Convex database and linked to Clerk authentication profiles. The interface accommodates users with varying digital literacy levels while maintaining robust security standards for handling sensitive health information.

Administrators create schedules via web admin panel specifying date, time range, venue with capacity, and instructor information, synchronized immediately to the mobile application. Users browse available sessions and book preferred time slots with real-time availability preventing overbooking. Upon booking, the system generates unique QR codes displayed in the mobile application as digital tickets. Automated push notifications are sent 24 hours before and on event mornings, reducing no-shows. CHO staff with inspector role interfaces use built-in QR scanners to verify identity and record check-in and check-out timestamps. The system automatically marks orientation complete when both scans register, eliminating paper-based roll calls and preventing fraudulent attendance. Administrators review participant lists, verify completion, and finalize sessions, triggering automatic application progression. Historical attendance records support auditing and trend reporting.

Online Payment and Digital Health Card Releasing Module
      The payment and health card releasing module handles financial transactions and issues official digital health cards upon final approval. Users complete payment through Maya payment gateway for seamless online transactions or upload receipt photographs from designated City Health Office cashier locations. The system automatically adds a ten-peso administrative processing fee with total amounts clearly displayed. Upon administrative payment confirmation, applications enter final review. After approval, the system automatically generates digital health cards retrieving applicant photographs, extracting personal information, assigning unique registration numbers, applying color coding, calculating one-year expiration dates, and generating unique QR codes encoding registration numbers and verification data. Elements are assembled into HTML templates matching official City Health Office designs. Generated cards are stored in complete HTML form within Convex database preserving exact layout, content, and official signatures for historical accuracy. Users receive push notifications when cards become available, accessing the health card section to view, download, and share credentials. Embedded QR codes enable quick inspector verification, prevent forgery through cryptographic validation, and provide contactless verification during monitoring activities. Inspector interfaces retrieve associated records displaying cardholder information, registration numbers, job categories, dates, and card status (active, expired, revoked). Administrators possess authority to revoke cards for falsified results or disqualifying findings, immediately marking cards invalid with revocation status and reasons displayed during QR scans.

Design of Software, System, Product, and/or Processes
      Following the requirements gathering and analysis phase, the design of the eMediCard mobile application was thoughtfully structured to balance user accessibility with administrative control, ensuring that the system effectively addresses the health card processing needs of Davao City. The team prioritized creating a platform that is both scalable and adaptable, allowing for future enhancements while meeting the immediate requirements identified through stakeholder interviews.
      To visualize the user interface (UI) and ensure usability for both applicants and administrators, the team used Figma to design and prototype the app's layout. The mockups included modules for registration, document uploads, status tracking, and digital card issuance. These visual representations helped validate workflows early in the process.
      In addition to designing the user interface and backend schema, the team developed comprehensive UML diagrams to visualize system behavior and structure. Use Case Diagrams capture the functional relationships between users and system processes. Activity Diagrams model detailed workflows for each major feature. Sequence Diagrams illustrate the chronological interactions between system components for specific scenarios. Domain Class Diagrams define the core data entities and their relationships, ensuring a robust database structure that maintains referential integrity throughout the application lifecycle.
      The system's main user interactions are illustrated through use case diagrams, which highlight the functional relationships between users (applicants and CHO admins) and system processes.
      As the system uses a NoSQL database (Convex), a traditional Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was not used. Instead, a document-based schema was developed using tables that store key-value data similar to rows in SQL. Each table can organize related data hierarchically such as documents under each application. This flexible structure mirrors the logical flow of the health card process and eliminates the need for complex table joins.
      The system was structured around several core modules that serve both applicants and CHO administrators. The user journey begins with the User Registration and Verification module. Here, applicants create a secure account by entering their email and password, followed immediately by uploading a verification document (such as a Valid ID, Medical Certificate, or Expired Health Card) to authenticate their identity. Once the account is created and verified, users proceed to the Application Module, where they enter personal information such as full name, age, civil status, nationality, organization, and position, and submit required documents for their health card classification.
      To support classification, the Health Card Type Identification system automatically determines the user's card type based on occupation. For Yellow card applicants, the Orientation Scheduling module displays available seminar slots and sends attendance reminders.
      The Payment module integrates with Maya payment gateway and supports manual uploads of payment receipts, providing flexibility for users to complete transactions. After approval, the Digital Health Card Generation and Release module allows users to download their digital health card directly from the app, containing all essential personal and classification data.
      To make seminar attendance more efficient, the system includes QR code-based tracking for Yellow card holders, enabling real-time confirmation and reducing administrative workload. Push notifications further assist users by reminding them of pending actions such as missing documents or upcoming orientations.
      The system architecture leverages Convex's real-time reactive queries ensuring that application status updates, document approvals, and payment confirmations are reflected instantly across all connected devices without requiring manual refresh actions, providing immediate feedback to both applicants and administrators throughout the health card issuance process.
      Finally, the system features a comprehensive Admin Dashboard for CHO personnel. This interface enables administrators to manage and review submissions, approve or reject applications, assign orientation schedules, and generate reports to monitor system activity.


Development
      eMediCard: A Mobile-Based Health Card Management System followed established software engineering standards and best practices to ensure functionality, efficiency, security, and maintainability. The system was created using the Modified Waterfall Model methodology, which allowed the developers to plan, design, build, test, and refine the system in sequential phases with limited feedback loops when critical issues were discovered.
Adherence to Standards
* Coding Standards 

      Component files followed PascalCase naming (e.g., ApplicationRestrictionModal.tsx, PaymentCard.tsx), utilities used kebab-case (e.g., status-utils.ts, rejection-utils.ts), and Convex database tables used camelCase (e.g., users, applications, documentUploads, orientationBookings). Each function was documented using inline comments and JSDoc annotations. The codebase followed feature-based architecture organizing related components, utilities, and models together.
* Software Design Standards

      The system used component-based architecture following React Native and Expo best practices, separating UI components, business logic, and data access layers. Convex functions were organized into queries (read operations) and mutations (write operations), ensuring clear separation of concerns and allowing independent component updates.
* Database Design Standards

      A normalized database structure was implemented using Convex's schema definition system. Referential relationships were enforced through ID-based linking across tables such as applications, users, healthCards, and orientationBookings. Indexes were applied to frequently queried fields like clerkId, applicationId, and userId to optimize query performance.
* Security Standards

      Authentication and authorization through Clerk implemented role-based access control for applicants, administrators, inspectors, and system administrators. Convex function-level permissions restricted data access to authorized users only. Sensitive documents were stored in encrypted Convex file storage. Input validation was applied on both client and server sides.
* User Interface (UI) and Experience (UX) Standards

      The mobile interface used React Native components with Expo's design system, focusing on usability and responsiveness across Android devices. Color schemes followed CHO branding with color-coded classification (Yellow, Green, Pink) maintained throughout the user journey. Navigation patterns were intuitive with clear visual hierarchy, ensuring accessibility for users with varying digital literacy levels.
Development Tools and Environment
      The mobile application was developed using React Native version 0.81.4 with Expo SDK version 54.0.12, which streamlined development through integrated build tools, instant testing via Expo Go, and simplified deployment using Expo Application Services (EAS). The system's data was stored using Convex version 1.27.3, a real-time serverless database platform supporting reactive queries and automatic synchronization. User authentication was handled through Clerk Expo version 2.13.2, integrating seamlessly with both mobile application and Convex backend.
      
      For version control, Git and GitHub managed source code versions and team collaboration. Visual Studio Code served as the primary IDE with extensions for React Native, Expo, and JavaScript development. Figma was used for UI prototyping and design mockups. Testing was conducted using Expo Go for real-time preview on physical Android devices. Node.js and npm managed package dependencies throughout the development lifecycle.
Implementation Process
Planning Phase 
      The team identified key objectives, features, timeline, and resources. Project modules were assigned to each developer for efficient workflow management. Coding conventions, version control protocols, and communication channels were established.

      System diagrams (Use Case, Activity, Sequence, Domain Class) were created to illustrate system logic, data flow, and structural relationships. Mockups were developed using Figma for screens including registration, application submission, document upload, orientation booking, and digital health card display.
Coding and Integration Phase 
     Each module was implemented following approved design specifications. Clerk authentication was integrated first, followed by Convex database schema creation. React Native screens were built using functional components and React hooks. Convex queries and mutations handled data retrieval and updates with proper permission checks. File upload functionality used Convex's file storage API. Real-time notifications alerted users of status changes and upcoming orientations.
Testing Phase 
     Unit testing verified individual Convex function data validation and business logic. Integration testing assessed communication between mobile components, Clerk authentication, and Convex backend services. User acceptance testing (UAT) involved demonstrating the system to CHO personnel and sample users, gathering feedback on usability and workflow accuracy. Bugs were logged, prioritized, and corrected before final validation.
Evaluation and Refinement Phase 
      The system was reviewed based on performance, security, user feedback, and alignment with CHO operational requirements. Adjustments improved response times, enhanced error messaging, and refined interface layouts. Additional validation rules were implemented based on CHO administrator feedback.
Collaboration and Version Management
      The team used GitHub as the central repository to coordinate development tasks. Each member contributed to different modules but adhered to shared coding conventions and commit message formats. Pull requests were reviewed before merging into the main branch, ensuring code quality. Regular team meetings addressed technical challenges and aligned design decisions.
Quality Assurance
      Quality assurance was maintained through peer code reviews, adherence to software design principles, and continuous testing. The project adviser, Ms. Reinamie G. Dayrit, regularly reviewed progress and provided feedback to ensure compliance with academic standards and industry best practices. Testing on multiple Android devices with varying screen sizes and operating system versions ensured broad compatibility and reliable performance.

The integration between mobile app, web admin, and backend services operates seamlessly, providing a smooth user experience for both applicants and administrators.
Description of Prototype
      The EMediCard system prototype is a fully functional digital health card management platform designed specifically for Davao City's health card application and renewal process. The system comprises three main components that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for health certificate management.
System Requirements
      The eMediCard system is designed to run on widely available devices with minimal setup. Applicants use an Android smartphone (Android 8.0 or higher) with a working camera, at least 2 GB of RAM and about 100 MB of free storage. A stable internet connection is required for registration, document uploads, payment, orientation booking, and health card download; devices with 4 GB of RAM provide smoother performance during uploads. Inspectors may use any QR-capable smartphone to scan attendance through a browser-based interface at the venue.
      City Health Office (CHO) administrators access the web dashboard on a desktop or laptop with an Intel Core i3/AMD Ryzen 3 (or higher), at least 4 GB of RAM, and a display of 1366×768 or better. The dashboard runs on modern browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Mozilla Firefox. Reliable office internet (about 3 Mbps or higher per active staff) is recommended to preview documents and update records without delay.
      The production stack uses React Native 0.81.4 with Expo SDK 54.0.12 for the mobile application, Convex 1.27.3 for real-time data and server functions, Clerk Expo 2.13.2 for secure authentication with email verification, and Maya as the payment gateway. Push notifications are delivered using Expo services. No on-premises servers are required since all backend services are cloud-hosted.
      Security and operational requirements include verified user accounts, role-based admin access, encrypted data transfer over HTTPS, routine backups of Convex data, and audit logs covering document and payment actions. The CHO should maintain simple data retention and recovery procedures consistent with policy. For development and maintenance, Node.js and Expo EAS Build are used by the team, but these tools are not required for applicants or CHO staff.
Testing and Evaluation Methodology
      The testing and evaluation of eMediCard followed the stages of the Modified Waterfall Model and were conducted on Android devices (8.0 and above) and modern desktop browsers for the admin dashboard. The approach combined white-box testing for core logic (Convex functions and validations) and black-box testing for end-user flows across registration, document submission, payment, orientation, approval, and digital card release.
      Functional testing verified each module independently. For applicants, tests covered email-verified registration, classification-based document checklists, file uploads with type/size validation, payment through Maya and manual receipt upload, orientation booking for Yellow card holders, and card download with QR. For administrators, tests covered document preview and verification, payment validation, orientation schedule creation and attendance finalization, and consolidated approval with remarks.
      Integration testing ensured components worked together reliably. The mobile app and admin dashboard were tested against Convex (data and workflows), Clerk (authentication and sessions), and Maya (payment initiation and callback handling). Success criteria included correct status updates after each step, accurate synchronization between mobile and dashboard, and valid QR scans reflecting attendance and card status. Maya was validated in sandbox; callbacks were checked to ensure payment states were saved and visible to admins.
      System testing assessed overall stability, performance, and basic security. Typical checks included app start-up time, responsiveness during form entry and uploads, document preview loading in the dashboard, and reliability of push notifications. Edge cases intermittent connectivity, interrupted uploads, invalid file types, expired sessions, and repeated QR scans were exercised to confirm clear error messages and safe handling.
      User acceptance testing (UAT) involved CHO staff and sample applicants performing end-to-end tasks: submit an application, complete payment, attend orientation (Yellow), and receive approval with a downloadable digital card. Administrators validated documents, payments, and attendance, then issued approvals. Feedback from UAT informed small refinements to button sizes, contrast, loading behavior for images and lists, and clearer notifications and error prompts.
      Test recording used concise tables (Test ID, Scenario, Expected Result, Actual Result, Remarks) for registration, login, application, uploads, payment, orientation, QR validation, admin verification, approval, health card generation, and renewal. Defects were logged, prioritized (critical/major/minor), fixed, and re-tested, with a short regression pass on affected areas. Overall, results met the defined functional goals and non-functional expectations for responsiveness and clarity, with noted limitations (Android-only, stable internet required, deliberate admin review for compliance) carried forward as part of normal CHO operations.
Implementation Plan
      Deployment focuses on two components: the mobile application for applicants and the web dashboard for CHO personnel. A production Convex deployment will be configured with the final schema, indexes for common queries, and backups enabled. Initial reference data classifications and their document requirements, orientation venues, and administrator accounts will be loaded to ensure a smooth start. Clerk will be prepared in a production instance with CHO-branded email templates for verification and password reset, appropriate password and session policies, and API keys securely linked to the backend. Maya will be switched from sandbox to live credentials.
      The Android application will be built with Expo's EAS Build using production endpoints and keys. The signed package will be distributed initially through a direct installer, with the option to publish more broadly later. Before rolling out, end-to-end testing will verify core user journeys: email-verified registration, classification-based upload and validation, payment through Maya and manual receipt verification, orientation booking and QR attendance for Yellow, administrative approval with remarks, and digital card release and download. Any issues found will be addressed prior to full deployment.
      CHO personnel will receive concise training on the dashboard: logging in, reviewing submissions with previews, approving or returning items with remarks, validating payments, creating and finalizing orientation schedules, and completing approvals. Short user guides and quick-reference materials will be provided. Applicants will be informed through posted instructions on how to install the app, register and verify email, upload documents, pay, track their status, and download their health card. Site needs are minimal: stable internet at CHO offices, modern browsers for administrators, Android smartphones for applicants, and QR-capable phones for inspectors. Adoption will begin with a short pilot alongside the manual process for a small group, followed by full rollout and phased retirement of manual intake, with a help channel available during transition.
Implementation Results
      Deployment proceeded according to plan. The Android application built via EAS ran reliably on devices from Android 8 to 13. The production Convex environment, Clerk authentication, and Maya payments were configured and validated, and reference data was loaded successfully. End-to-end testing showed that the main workflows behaved as intended: registration with email verification, classification-specific uploads with clear validations, orientation booking and QR-based attendance logging (check-in and check-out) for Yellow card holders, payment through Maya and manual receipt verification, administrative review and approval with remarks, and digital health card generation and download with QR verification. Real-time updates appeared promptly in both the mobile app and admin dashboard.
      Several improvements were made during validation. On mobile, button sizes and contrast were adjusted to improve readability and tap accuracy; image and list loading were optimized to display faster over typical connections; notifications and error prompts were rewritten to be clearer and more actionable (for example, identifying the specific document that needs correction). After these refinements, the system was assessed as ready for full use. It reduces in-person congestion by moving the process online, shortens turnaround time by keeping applicants informed, and supports peak renewal volumes with a clear and auditable flow. As the system scales, practical next steps include enabling additional payment options alongside Maya, adding simple analytics for CHO (volumes by classification, processing time, and common rejection reasons), and preparing an iOS version for broader device support.
Conclusion
      The eMediCard project responds to the long queues, manual workload, and inconsistent tracking in the City Health Office (CHO) by digitizing health card registration and renewal through a mobile application and an administrator web dashboard. Guided by the Modified Waterfall Model and implemented with React Native and Expo, Convex, Clerk, and Maya, the system delivers the complete process flow from email-verified registration, classification-based requirements, and document uploads to payment, orientation booking and QR attendance for Yellow card holders, approval, and release of a digital health card with QR verification. Testing and pilot validation indicate that the system improves visibility for applicants, shortens processing time through clearer status updates and consolidated admin review, and reduces in-person congestion during peak renewal periods.
      The project objectives were met by implementing the required user and administrator modules, including registration and authentication, classification and document submission, payment handling, orientation scheduling and attendance logging, administrative verification and approval with remarks, and digital card generation. In practice, these modules worked together reliably and aligned with existing CHO procedures, allowing staff to maintain compliance while gaining efficiency. Noted limitations Android-only availability at present, the need for stable internet for real-time features, and the continued necessity of deliberate administrative checks for documents and payments are appropriate to the CHO's operating context and inform next steps.
Recommendations
      The eMediCard system is ready to be introduced through a short pilot alongside the current manual process, then rolled out to all applicants. During the pilot, the City Health Office should provide simple user guides for applicants and concise standard operating procedures for staff, keep a help channel for common issues, and collect feedback to refine instructions and screen wording before full deployment. After rollout, CHO should regularly monitor a small set of indicators such as applications per day by classification, average processing time from submission to approval, and the most frequent rejection reasons to guide staffing and improve turnaround time.
      For payments, continue using Maya and prepare to add additional methods as CHO policy allows. For platform coverage, plan an iOS version after initial deployment and apply accessibility improvements like stronger contrast, larger tap targets, and text size presets to support a wider range of users. To strengthen operations and compliance, adopt clear data retention and backup schedules, maintain audit logs for document and payment actions, and apply regular updates to the mobile app, admin dashboard, and backend services. Provide short refresher training for staff on verification, scheduling, approvals, and reporting, and maintain brief applicant FAQs to reduce repetitive inquiries.
      To support performance during peak months, periodically review database indexes and file handling, optimize image loading for document previews, and keep a tested rollback plan with routine restore drills for backups. As the system matures, add simple analytics dashboards and exportable reports to help CHO management track volumes, processing time, and rejection trends, and consider optional integrations with other CHO systems to streamline administrative work without changing the validated workflow.
