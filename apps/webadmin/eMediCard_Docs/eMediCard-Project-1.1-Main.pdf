INTRODUCTION 
Project Context 
Mobile app development is rapidly growing. From retail, telecommunications 
and e-commerce to insurance, healthcare and government, organizations across 
industries must meet user expectations for real-time, convenient ways to conduct 
transactions and access information. 
Today, mobile devices and the mobile applications that unlock their value are 
the most popular way for people and businesses to connect to the internet. To stay 
relevant, responsive and successful, organizations need to develop the mobile 
applications that their customers, partners and employee’s demand. Though mobile 
application development might seem challenging. Once selected the OS platform or 
platforms, this needs to overcome the limitations of mobile devices and usher the app 
all the way past the potential hurdles of distribution. Fortunately, through following a 
few basic guidelines and best practices, this can optimize application development 
journey. Rapid technological advancements have reformed everyday life in every 
sector, particularly in healthcare. Modernization has resulted in innovative tools and 
digital platforms to improve communication, data management, and service delivery. 
Consequently, telemedicine, electronic health records, new technologies in patient 
remote monitoring, and other innovations have evolved continuously through extensive 
research and advancements over the past few decades.  
These advancements are not limited to improving healthcare quality but also to 
other ways by which patients and providers communicate. Recent studies on mobile 
renewal systems, such as those implemented by Ghana’s National Health Insurance 
Scheme (Akweongo et al., 2023; BMJ Glob Health) and Propel’s Medicaid renewal 
campaign (Propel, 2023), demonstrate that moving from traditional in-person processes 
to mobile platforms can significantly reduce waiting times and improve overall service 
responsiveness. By enabling users to complete renewals via their smartphones, these 
initiatives reduce administrative burdens and enhance user satisfaction through real
1 
STI College Davao                    
time updates and efficient procedures. 
In Davao City, the annual renewal of health cards for employees is a critical yet 
challenging process. Every year especially January, thousands of workers must 
physically visit designated venues to update their health records—a method that often 
leads to overcrowded sites, lengthy queues, and delays that disrupt work schedules. 
While traditional renewal methods help verify employee fitness, they frequently result 
in missed deadlines and inefficiencies due to the sheer volume of renewals. Attempts 
to improve access through general social media pages have also fallen short, as these 
platforms are prone to duplication and fraudulent activity, which can compromise data 
integrity and user trust.  
Recent reports indicate that Davao's job growth is driven by a surge in 
investments, a booming tourism industry, expanding infrastructure projects, and the 
rapidly growing BPO sector. This dynamic economic environment has resulted in a 
larger, more active workforce, intensifying the demand for an efficient health card 
renewal process. With more employees entering the job market and a lower 
unemployment rate, optimizing the renewal process becomes even more critical to 
ensure that every worker remains compliant with health regulations. 
In the article "CHO urges workers to renew health cards," posted on January 
23, 2023, the City Health Office (CHO) reported that to accommodate the high volume 
of applicants, they have designated venues like Gaisano Ilustre for processing health 
cards, with daily processing numbers reaching up to 1,400 applicants. Despite these 
efforts, the substantial number of employees required to renew their health cards 
annually often leads to congestion and long waiting times at processing centers. 
To address these issues, the developers propose a mobile application for health 
card registration and renewal. This application will allow employees to update their 
information directly from their smartphones, thereby reducing physical congestion and 
cutting down processing time. With features such as status updates, secure digital 
documentation, and an intuitive user interface, this will offer a reliable and accessible 
alternative to the current in-person renewal process.

Purpose and Description 
The purpose of this project is to develop a mobile application that facilitates the 
registration and annual renewal of health cards for employees in Davao City. Currently, 
the process requires thousands of employees to visit designated venues each January, 
where they undergo health evaluations and update their records. This traditional 
method often leads to overcrowding, long queues, and delays that disrupt work 
schedules. It also places a heavy administrative burden on the City Health Office 
(CHO), resulting in missed deadlines and inefficiencies. To address these challenges, 
this project aims to replace the conventional in-person system with a mobile-based 
solution accessible directly from employees’ smartphones. 
The proposed application will enable users to register and submit necessary 
information, including personal details and medical documents—such as chest X-ray, 
CBC, urinalysis, fecalysis, drug test, neuropsychiatric test, Hepatitis B antibody test, 
valid ID, Community Tax Certificate, health card receipt (OR), and a 1x1 picture. The 
system is designed with an intuitive interface to support users with varying levels of 
digital literacy. It also integrates payment options, allowing users to pay through in-app 
platforms like GCash or submit proof of payment from designated physical locations. 
A ₱10 transaction fee will automatically be added to the total amount during each 
payment to cover administrative or processing costs. 
Applicants will identify whether they are food or non-food workers through a 
classification system that assigns color-coded health card types: Yellow for food 
handlers (e.g., service crew, kitchen staff), Green for non-food industry workers (e.g., 
security guards, receptionists, BPO staff), and Pink for occupations involving direct 
skin contact (e.g., barbers, massage therapists, tattoo artists). Food handlers will be 
required to attend a mandatory food safety orientation with a sanitary inspector and 
they will receive a schedule appointment. Non-food and pink card applicants may 
proceed directly with the process unless otherwise instructed. 
To enhance transparency, the app provides real-time status updates and 
notifications to inform applicants about their progress, missing requirements, or next 
3 
STI College Davao                    
steps. If an applicant is disapproved—often due to incomplete documents or medical 
findings—the system will display a personalized follow-up checklist, suggest nearby 
health centers, and guide them through the additional tests needed before they can 
reapply. 
Once an application is approved, the app will notify the applicant that their 
health card is ready for release. The health card can be accessed and downloaded 
through the application, containing the user’s personal details, photo, classification 
color, and expiration date. This digital release process eliminates the need for physical 
claiming and ensures a more secure, efficient, and user-friendly distribution of health 
cards. 
Overall, the eMediCard mobile application is envisioned as a complete solution 
to improve the efficiency, security, and accessibility of the health card renewal process 
in Davao City. The system will be managed by both applicants and City Health Office 
(CHO) administrators. Applicants can register, submit requirements, track their status, 
and receive notifications. Administrators will be able to verify documents, manage 
compliance, send updates, and generate reports for monitoring and future 
improvements.

This project is only a mobile-based application, meaning that its functionality is 
limited to mobile platforms and does not extend to native desktop or web-based versions. 
For now, the application is specifically developed for Android devices only, and does not 
currently support iOS or other operating systems. The system is specifically tailored for 
the health card renewal process in Davao City, designed to meet local administrative 
practices and regulatory requirements, which may not be readily adaptable to other regions 
without substantial modifications. Although the application incorporates advanced features 
such as secure digital document uploads, real-time status updates, and mandatory food 
safety orientation, it relies on users having a basic level of digital literacy and stable internet 
access. Additionally, certain processes—such as the physical verification of documents—
 may still require manual intervention, potentially causing delays in processing.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE/STUDIES/SYSTEMS 
Related Studies and/or Systems 
Mobile Health Card Application System (Itransition, 2024) 
The research conducted by Itransition (2024) was to design a mobile health card 
application system through which the patients can retrieve their medical information, book 
appointments, and converse with healthcare providers. The system is integrated with IoT 
and wearables to remotely capture health information securely and make healthcare 
services better. Based on Itransition (2024), the major issue in conventional healthcare 
systems is the insufficient availability of effective medical record access. Patients find it 
difficult to deal with paperwork and scheduling appointments manually, which causes 
inefficiencies and delays in medical treatment. With the processes being digitized, the 
mobile health card application provides a smooth flow of data access and management. 
The system allows for quicker and more streamlined healthcare procedures, 
enabling users to keep and retrieve their health records online. Patients can book 
appointments with healthcare providers, get reminders about appointments, and monitor 
their medical history in one platform. Furthermore, integration with wearable devices 
provides real-time monitoring of health conditions, encouraging active healthcare 
management. 
The patient has access to the login and registration page, where he or she may 
modify his or her medical history, view appointment schedules, and obtain personalized 
health information. Health providers, on the other hand, can securely manage patient 
information, monitor health trends, and streamline medical workflows.

mHealth Solutions for Digital Healthcare (OSP Labs, 2023) 
In the research conducted by OSP Labs (2023), mHealth solutions were created to 
make healthcare services easily accessible and convenient through online platforms. They 
are comprised of mobile apps, wearables, and remote monitoring equipment that was 
developed to help patients monitor their health, meet with medical professionals, and 
implement wellness plans.  As per OSP Labs (2023), the main challenge in healthcare is 
the accessibility gap, particularly among patients in rural regions. Integrating mHealth 
solutions helps bridge this gap by providing telemedicine consultations, medication 
reminders, and real-time health monitoring capabilities.  
The mHealth platform increases efficiency through the digitization of scheduling 
appointments, prescribing electronically, and virtual consultations. The app enables 
patients to schedule appointments, access health alerts, and securely share medical reports 
with healthcare professionals. The use of AI-powered analytics also helps to identify early 
disease symptoms, and timely medical interventions are ensured.  
Administrators and care providers can equally gain from the system as they can 
monitor patient records, derive trends from health data, and enhance the provision of 
healthcare by means of targeted treatment plans. The digitization of healthcare services via 
mHealth applications aids better patient involvement as well as medical outcomes.

Mobile Health Regulations and Compliance (Federal Trade Commission, 2023) 
The Federal Trade Commission (2023) performed a study on regulatory compliance 
in mobile health apps. The study highlights that while online healthcare platforms are of 
many benefits, they have to follow rigorous privacy, security, and data protection rules to 
uphold patient trust and confidentiality.  As per the FTC (2023), most of the healthcare 
apps are subject to legal and ethical issues surrounding data security. If there are no proper 
compliance practices, there are chances of leaking sensitive health data, and that is highly 
detrimental to both patients and healthcare professionals.  
In response to these challenges, the FTC launched an interactive guide to assist 
developers in complying with privacy legislation like HIPAA and GDPR. The guide assists 
mobile health developers in ensuring their apps are up to standard security levels, securing 
patient information from improper access. Through compliance regulations, healthcare 
apps can strengthen data security, win the trust of patients, and legally conduct business in 
the digital health market. Adhering to stringent cybersecurity protocols is essential for 
long-term success and acceptance of mobile health technology.

Synthesis 
The review of related studies and systems emphasize the transformative potential 
of mobile health technologies in modernizing healthcare services, enhancing patient 
accessibility, and ensuring regulatory compliance. The Mobile Health Card Application 
System (Itransition, 2024) addresses inefficiencies in conventional healthcare systems by 
digitizing medical record access, appointment scheduling, and real-time health monitoring 
through IoT and wearable integration. Similarly, mHealth Solutions for Digital Healthcare 
(OSP Labs, 2023) highlight the role of mobile applications in bridging healthcare 
accessibility gaps, particularly in rural areas. By incorporating telemedicine, AI-powered 
analytics, and remote health monitoring, these solutions enhance efficiency and patient 
engagement while streamlining medical workflows. 
However, with the growing reliance on digital health platforms, regulatory 
compliance and data security remain critical challenges. The Federal Trade Commission 
(2023) underscores the importance of adhering to privacy regulations such as HIPAA and 
GDPR to protect sensitive patient information. The study highlights the risks associated 
with improper compliance and the need for robust cybersecurity measures to prevent data 
breaches. Ensuring that mobile health applications meet legal and ethical standards is 
crucial for gaining patient trust and promoting widespread adoption of digital healthcare 
solutions. 
These findings align with the objectives of eMediCard: A Mobile-Based Health 
Card Application System, which aims to facilitate health card applications, reduce 
processing time, and minimize overcrowding in government offices. Inspired by 
Itransition’s mobile health card system, eMediCard seeks to provide a secure and user
friendly digital platform for health record access and appointment management. 
Additionally, the concerns raised by the FTC study emphasize the need for strong data 
security protocols, ensuring patient information is safeguarded against unauthorized 
access. By addressing these challenges, eMediCard can contribute to the modernization of 
healthcare services in the Philippines, making medical processes more efficient, secure, 
and accessible for all citizen

METHODOLOGY 
Technical Background 
Technologies to be Used  
The eMediCard system will use a set of open-source technologies chosen 
for their ease of use, speed of development, and reliable performance. Flutter, 
Google’s UI toolkit, will provide a single codebase that compiles into native 
machine code for Android. Flutter’s hot reload feature and wide range of widgets 
will enable quick iteration on user interfaces, covering steps from registration and 
document upload to payment and orientation scheduling while maintaining a 
consistent look and feel across devices. 
For writing and debugging our Flutter code, we rely mainly on Visual 
Studio Code a lightweight, extensible editor that accelerates development with rich 
plugin support—while using Android Studio when we need more advanced 
profiling, emulator management, or deep integration with the Android SDK. This 
hybrid IDE approach maximizes productivity, letting developers choose the right 
tool for each task without sacrificing performance or debug visibility. 
Database Methodology 
The eMediCard backend will use Firebase Firestore, Google’s fully 
managed NoSQL document database, for all persistent data. We will define 
collections for user profiles, application records, document metadata, payment 
transactions, and orientation schedules. Firestore’s real-time synchronization 
ensures that status changes— such as an admin confirming a payment or approving 
a document—propagate immediately to the Android client without polling. During 
development and testing, we will employ the Firestore Emulator to simulate 
database interactions locally, enabling offline-first testing and validation of security 
rules and indexing exactly as they run in production. This setup combines the 
14 
STI College Davao                    
scalability and low-maintenance advantages of a cloud database with thorough pre
deployment testing. 
Software Development Approach (Waterfall Model) 
The development of the eMediCard mobile application follows the 
Waterfall Model, a structured, phase-oriented methodology that progresses 
sequentially through Requirements Gathering, System Design, Implementation, 
Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase is marked by well-defined 
deliverables and validation checkpoints before advancing to the next, promoting 
strong planning, documentation, and traceability. This method supports the secure 
handling of sensitive health data and ensures alignment with the regulatory 
standards of the City Health Office. Refer to Page 31, Figure 2. 
In this development cycle, the team concentrated on the early stages of the 
Waterfall process, specifically, the Requirements Analysis and Design Phases. 
During requirements analysis, all key system functionalities were identified and 
documented in accordance with the actual workflow of health card issuance. These 
include user registration, classification-based document submission, payment 
processing, and orientation scheduling. The requirements were validated through 
field research and stakeholder interviews to ensure accuracy and relevance. 
Following this, the Design Phase involved the formulation of system 
architecture, database schema, and user interface prototypes. Tools such as Figma 
were used to create interactive mockups that demonstrate how users will navigate 
the application, from submitting applications to viewing their orientation schedules. 
These visual artifacts serve as the technical foundation for the upcoming 
Implementation Phase. 
In the Implementation Phase the developers will convert the approved 
design assets—Figma mockups, Firestore schemas, and API definitions—into 
working Flutter code. This will set up the project in Visual Studio Code, integrate 
Firebase services, and build each core feature (user registration, document uploads, 
15 
STI College Davao                    
payments, notifications, and digital card generation) in parallel via Git feature 
branches with peer reviews. UI components will follow the established design 
system, and security rules for Firestore will be created and tested locally. Every 
module will include unit tests (minimum 80 % coverage), and a continuous 
integration pipeline will enforce linting, builds, and automated tests on each 
commit. 
During the Testing Phase, the developers and QA Testers will jointly verify 
functionality, usability, performance, and security. Automated integration tests will 
run through critical flows, including signup, document submission and approval, 
orientation scheduling, and card release, using the Firestore emulator. Manual 
testing on various Android devices will catch UI and edge-case issues (e.g., upload 
interruptions, low bandwidth), while security checks will challenge authentication 
and Firestore rules. Defects will be tracked, prioritized, and fixed in rapid sprints, 
followed by an acceptance test with City Health Office stakeholders to ensure 
compliance with real-world workflows and regulations. 
In the Deployment Phase, the developers will assemble a signed, 
release-mode Android App Bundle (AAB) for the Google Play Console, including 
screenshots, metadata, release notes, and a privacy policy. An initial beta rollout to 
CHO staff and selected users will surface any critical issues before full production 
release. After successful beta feedback, the build moves to production. Post-release, 
Firebase Crashlytics and Google Analytics will monitor app health and usage, and 
a rollback plan will allow swift reversion to the previous stable version if necessary. 
Finally, at the Maintenance Phase, developers and QA Testers will 
continuously monitor the live application for bugs, performance hiccups, and user 
feedback. They will review Firebase Crashlytics and Google Analytics daily to 
identify crash trends or usability issues. Critical defects will be addressed 
immediately via hotfix branches, while minor updates and new feature requests will 
be grouped into the next sprint cycle. Security patches, such as updates to Firestore 
rules or third-party SDKs, will be applied as soon as vulnerabilities are discovered.

STI College Davao                    
Requirements Gathering and Analysis 
The requirements gathering for the eMediCard mobile application began with an 
interview with a City Health Office (CHO) staff member who oversee health card 
operations at the designated processing venue in Victoria Plaza. The interview provided 
the team with valuable insights into the end-to-end workflow of health card registration 
and renewal, along with common issues faced by both applicants and CHO personnel. 
Their broad operational knowledge enabled the team to understand the administrative 
routines, processing challenges, and compliance concerns that a digital system must 
address. According to City Health Office (CHO) records, renewal numbers surged during 
the first quarter of 2024, with 23,489 applicants in January, 29,185 in February, and 18,788 
in March. These peak months accounted for over 71,000 health card renewals in just three 
months. The high traffic volumes—particularly in January and February, where daily 
applicants reached up to 1,400—highlighted the strain placed on the manual system and 
reinforced the urgent need for a scalable, digital solution capable of managing bulk 
renewals efficiently. This significant demand highlighted the urgent need for a digital 
system capable of efficiently handling high traffic while minimizing delays and physical 
congestion. 
To contextualize these findings within the local framework, the team conducted 
field interviews and informal consultations with CHO personnel, health card applicants, 
and administrative staff involved in the current in-person process. These conversations 
provided essential insights into how applications were evaluated, what documents were 
typically submitted, and how orientations were scheduled and conducted—particularly for 
food industry workers who require a mandatory seminar. 
During the interview, the CHO staff member explained that when an applicant's 
submission is disapproved due to medical findings—such as pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) 
or urinary tract infection (UTI)—they are required to undergo a follow-up consultation 
with a physician. This additional check-up ensures applicants are medically cleared before 
continuing the health card process, which the app must accommodate through personalized 
feedback and follow-up guidance. This led the team to prioritize a user-friendly document 
19 
STI College Davao                    
submission interface capable of handling various file types  while enabling administrators 
to flag missing or questionable entries. This reinforced the need for real-time status 
notifications and dynamic checklists within the app. 
The team also engaged several employees from two local businesses—McDonald's 
Buhangin Pagibig Branch and Three J Watch Service Center from Gaisano Grand 
Illustre—who were frequent health card applicants. These users described the longest 
queue times as one of their main concerns during the renewal process, but noted that they 
clearly understood the difference between Yellow, Green, and Pink health card types. They 
explained that this information is included in the official paper provided during initial 
registration or renewal at the venue. However, they expressed frustration over the long 
waiting times during renewal, sharing that queues often extended outside the mall 
premises. Based on this, the team retained the classification system in the app but shifted 
focus toward enhancing user guidance, improving progress transparency, and introducing 
digital queuing features to reduce physical congestion. 
Another significant output of the analysis was the integration of payment 
functionality. Through feedback from both users and CHO finance staff, the team identified 
the importance of a flexible payment module that supports both online methods (e.g., 
GCash) and manual uploads of official receipts from physical payment centers. A fixed 
₱10 transaction fee was included as a feature for processing and recordkeeping purposes. 
At the end of the requirements analysis phase, the team compiled a comprehensive 
list of system needs, which included: user registration and profile management, 
classification-based document submission, digital orientation scheduling for Yellow card 
holders, payment integration, digital health card issuance, admin dashboard features, and 
real-time notification systems. These components were validated through both user-side 
interviews and administrative consultations, ensuring the solution was practical, secure, 
and aligned with the CHO’s workflow and compliance standards.

Safety Orientation schedules to Yellow Card (Food Handler) applicants. 
24 
STI College Davao                    
Admins can select an applicant, set the orientation date, choose a time slot, 
assign a Sanitary Inspector, and specify the orientation venue. Time slot 
availability is color-coded: green for available, yellow for almost full, and 
red for full. Once all fields are completed, admins can click the “Save 
Schedule” button to notify the user of their assigned orientation schedule. 
Refer to Page 38, Figure 19. 
Orientation Attendance Tracker Screen 
The Orientation Attendance Tracker screen allows admins to 
finalize user attendance for a scheduled Food Safety Orientation. Admins 
can select the orientation date, choose the assigned Sanitary Officer, and 
specify the orientation venue. A list of applicants registered for that 
schedule is displayed. Attendance status can be filtered and marked as 
“Pending,” “Attended,” or “Missed.” A QR code scanner is also integrated, 
allowing admins to verify attendance by scanning the applicant’s in-app QR 
code at the venue. An edit (pen) icon is available for adding CHO remarks, 
such as “Attended but arrived late.” Refer to Page 39, Figure 20. 
Notification Management Screen 
The Notification Management page enables admins to send 
notifications to users about updates such as Food Orientation Reminders, 
Health Card Approvals, or Incomplete Requirements. Admins can choose

Design of Software, System, Product, and/or Processes 
Following the requirements gathering and analysis phase, the design of the 
eMediCard mobile application was thoughtfully structured to balance user accessibility 
with administrative control, ensuring that the system effectively addresses the health card 
processing needs of Davao City. The team prioritized creating a platform that is both 
scalable and adaptable, allowing for future enhancements while meeting the immediate 
requirements identified through stakeholder interviews. 
To visualize the user interface (UI) and ensure usability for both applicants and 
administrators, the team used Figma to design and prototype the app's layout. The mockups 
included modules for registration, document uploads, status tracking, and digital card 
issuance. These visual representations helped validate workflows early in the process. 
As the system uses a NoSQL database (Firestore), a traditional Entity-Relationship 
Diagram (ERD) was not used. Instead, the team developed a document-based schema 
tailored for Firestore. This includes collections for users, applications, documents, 
payments, and orientation schedules, each containing subdocuments and fields that mirror 
the logical workflow of the health card process.  
In addition to designing the user interface and backend schema, the team developed 
a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) to gain a comprehensive understanding of how information 
flows throughout the eMediCard system. The DFD provides a graphical representation of 
the system’s processes, data inputs and outputs, and storage components. This visual tool 
was essential in mapping out key operations such as user registration, document 
submission, classification handling, orientation scheduling, payment processing, and 
digital health card issuance. Refer to Page 44-46, Figure 28-32 
The system’s main user interactions are also illustrated through a use case diagram, 
which highlights the functional relationships between users (applicants and CHO admins) 
and system processes. Refer to Page 44-46, Figure 28-32. 
26 
STI College Davao                    
The system was structured around several core modules that serve both applicants 
and CHO administrators. The first is the User Registration and Login module, which allows 
applicants to create secure accounts and log in to access their application data. During 
registration, users specify their job type, which the system uses to classify them under the 
appropriate health card category—Yellow for food handlers, Green for non-food industry 
workers, and Pink for occupations involving direct skin contact. Once registered, users 
proceed to the Profile and Document Upload module, where they enter personal 
information and submit required documents such as medical results, IDs, and proof of 
payment. 
To support classification, the Health Card Type Identification system automatically 
determines the user’s card type based on occupation. For Yellow card applicants, the 
Orientation Scheduling module displays available seminar slots and sends attendance 
reminders. 
The Payment module integrates with GCash and supports manual uploads of 
payment receipts, providing flexibility for users to complete transactions. After approval, 
the Digital Health Card Generation and Release module allows users to download their 
digital health card directly from the app, containing all essential personal and classification 
data. 
To make seminar attendance more efficient, the system includes QR code-based 
tracking for Yellow card holders, enabling real-time confirmation and reducing 
administrative workload. Push notifications further assist users by reminding them of 
pending actions such as missing documents or upcoming orientations. 
Finally, the system features a comprehensive Admin Dashboard for CHO 
personnel. This interface enables administrators to manage and review submissions, 
approve or reject applications, assign orientation schedules, and generate reports to monitor 
system activity.
