Description of Prototype

      The eMediCard prototype represents a comprehensive mobile-based solution designed to modernize the health card registration and renewal process for employees in Davao City. This section presents the system's architecture, requirements, core functionalities, and evaluation methodology, demonstrating how the prototype addresses the challenges of manual health card processing while ensuring efficiency, accessibility, and security for both applicants and City Health Office administrators.

System Overview

      The eMediCard prototype serves as a convenient and efficient digital platform for health card management, replacing the traditional in-person process that has resulted in severe overcrowding with over 1,400 daily applicants during peak months. The system enables employees to complete the entire health card application and renewal process remotely through their mobile devices, significantly reducing physical congestion at processing centers and minimizing disruptions to work schedules.

      The prototype demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow spanning both mobile and web platforms. On the mobile side, applicants can register accounts, submit classification-based applications, upload required medical documents, make payments through Maya payment gateway or manual receipt uploads, schedule mandatory food safety orientations for Yellow card holders, track application status in real-time, and download digital health cards upon approval. On the administrative side, City Health Office personnel access a web-based dashboard to validate submitted documents, verify payment transactions, manage orientation schedules, approve or reject applications with detailed feedback, and generate reports for monitoring and evaluation purposes.

      The system was developed following the Modified Waterfall Model methodology, ensuring systematic progression through requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment phases while allowing for limited iteration when critical issues were discovered. This structured approach ensured that the prototype remained aligned with City Health Office operational needs and Department of Health compliance standards throughout the development lifecycle.

System Requirements

      To ensure optimal performance and accessibility, the eMediCard system operates under specific hardware and software requirements that balance functionality with the technological capabilities of the target user base.

Hardware Requirements

      For mobile application users, the system requires Android devices running Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher with at least 2GB of RAM and 100MB of available storage space for application installation. While these specifications represent minimum requirements, devices with 4GB RAM or higher provide smoother performance, particularly during document upload processes. The mobile application was optimized for devices with screen sizes ranging from 5 to 6.5 inches, ensuring proper display of application forms, uploaded documents, and digital health cards across various Android smartphones commonly used by the target demographic.

      For City Health Office administrators utilizing the web-based dashboard, the system requires desktop computers or laptops with modern processors (Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 equivalent or higher), at least 4GB of RAM, and sufficient storage for processing uploaded documents and generating reports. Display resolution of 1366x768 or higher is recommended for optimal dashboard visibility and efficient document verification workflows.

      Both mobile and web platforms require stable internet connectivity with minimum speeds of 3 Mbps for smooth operation. This requirement supports real-time database synchronization through Convex, authentication through Clerk, document uploads to Convex file storage, and push notification delivery. While the system can function on slower connections, upload times for medical documents may be extended, and real-time status updates may experience minor delays.

Software Requirements

      The mobile application was developed using React Native 0.81.4 with Expo SDK 54.0.12, providing a native Android experience while enabling efficient development and deployment through Expo Application Services (EAS) Build. The application requires Android operating system version 8.0 or higher, with testing conducted across multiple Android versions (8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, 12, and 13) to ensure broad compatibility. No iOS version is currently available, though the React Native foundation allows for potential iOS deployment in future iterations.

      For administrators, the web-based dashboard requires modern web browsers including Google Chrome version 90 or higher, Microsoft Edge version 90 or higher, Mozilla Firefox version 88 or higher, or Safari version 14 or higher. The dashboard was optimized for Chrome and Edge browsers, which provide the best performance for document preview, image zoom capabilities, and real-time data updates. JavaScript must be enabled in the browser to support interactive dashboard features and real-time notifications.

      The system's backend infrastructure utilizes Convex 1.27.3 as the serverless database platform, eliminating the need for traditional server maintenance while providing real-time data synchronization across all connected clients. Authentication is managed through Clerk Expo 2.13.2, which handles user registration, email verification, session management, and secure access control. Payment processing integration with Maya payment gateway requires no additional software installation for users, as transactions are processed through secure web-based payment interfaces accessible from within the mobile application.

      Development tools used during prototype creation included Visual Studio Code as the primary integrated development environment, Node.js version 16 or higher for running Expo development servers, npm or yarn package managers for dependency management, and Figma for user interface design and prototyping. Git version control ensured proper code management throughout the development process.

Preliminary Design

      The eMediCard system architecture follows a client-server model that separates concerns between user-facing interfaces, business logic, and data persistence while leveraging modern cloud-based services for scalability and real-time capabilities.

      The client tier consists of two distinct interfaces: the React Native mobile application built with Expo framework for applicant-facing functionality, and the React-based web dashboard for administrative operations. Both clients communicate with backend services through secure HTTPS connections, ensuring data encryption during transmission. The mobile application was designed with offline capability considerations, allowing users to view previously loaded data when connectivity is temporarily unavailable, though active internet connection is required for submitting applications, uploading documents, and processing payments.

      The business logic tier is implemented through Convex backend functions written in TypeScript, which process all data operations, enforce business rules, and manage workflows. These serverless functions handle classification-based document requirements, payment validation including the automatic addition of the ten-peso processing fee, orientation scheduling logic for Yellow card applicants, application status transitions from submission through approval or rejection, and digital health card generation upon final approval. Convex's reactive query system ensures that when administrators approve documents or update application statuses, changes propagate instantly to mobile clients without requiring manual refresh actions.

      Authentication and authorization flow through Clerk, which manages user identity independently from the application database while integrating seamlessly with Convex through secure JWT token validation. When users register, Clerk handles email verification, password security, and session management, then provides a unique Clerk ID that links to the user's profile in the Convex database. This separation of concerns ensures that authentication logic remains secure and maintainable while allowing the application database to focus on health card processing data.

      The data persistence tier utilizes Convex's document-based database structure, organized into tables following camelCase naming conventions: users, applications, documentUploads, orientationBookings, healthCards, and notifications. Each table maintains referential integrity through ID-based relationships, with indexes on frequently queried fields such as clerkId, applicationId, and userId to optimize query performance. Document uploads are stored in Convex's encrypted file storage, with database records maintaining references to storage URLs and metadata such as file types, upload timestamps, and verification status.

      Payment processing integrates with Maya payment gateway through secure API connections, where the mobile application initiates payment requests with calculated totals (base fees plus the ten-peso processing fee), redirects users to Maya's secure payment interface, receives payment confirmation callbacks, and updates application payment status in the database. For manual payment uploads, the system stores receipt images in file storage and flags them for administrative verification.

      The notification system utilizes Expo's push notification services to deliver real-time alerts to mobile devices when application status changes, document verification results are available, orientation schedules are assigned, payment confirmation is received, or health cards become available for download. Notifications are stored in the database to provide an in-app notification history that users can review at any time.

Key Features Demonstrated

      The eMediCard prototype demonstrates several core features that collectively address the challenges of manual health card processing while improving efficiency and user experience.

      User registration with email verification establishes secure account creation where applicants provide personal information including full name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and gender. Upon submission, Clerk sends verification emails containing confirmation links that users must click to activate their accounts. This two-step verification process prevents fraudulent registrations and ensures that applicants provide valid contact information for future communications. The mobile application restricts access to core features until email verification is completed, displaying clear prompts that guide users through the verification process.

      Classification-based application processing represents a key innovation in the system, where users select their occupational category from Yellow (food handlers such as restaurant staff and kitchen workers), Green (non-food workers such as security guards, BPO employees, and receptionists), or Pink (skin-to-skin contact occupations such as barbers, massage therapists, and tattoo artists). Based on the selected classification, the system dynamically generates customized document checklists that reflect the specific requirements for each category. Users upload documents in PDF, JPEG, or PNG formats, with the system validating file types and sizes before accepting uploads. Progress indicators show completion status for each required document, helping users identify missing items before final submission.

      Document upload functionality includes support for chest X-ray results, complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis, fecalysis, drug test results, neuropsychiatric test results, Hepatitis B antibody test (for food handlers), valid government-issued ID, Community Tax Certificate (cedula), health card payment receipt (official receipt), and 1x1 photograph. Each document type has specific validation rules, and the system provides clear error messages when uploads fail validation, such as file size exceeding limits or unsupported file formats.

      Orientation scheduling for Yellow card holders automates the mandatory food safety seminar requirement. When Yellow card applicants' documents are verified, the system displays available orientation sessions showing date, time, venue, available slots, and instructor information. Users select their preferred session, and upon confirmation, the system generates a unique QR code displayed in the mobile application that serves as their attendance ticket. Automated push notifications remind users 24 hours before the scheduled orientation and on the morning of the event, reducing no-show rates. At the venue, CHO inspectors scan QR codes using the inspector interface to record check-in and check-out timestamps, with the system automatically marking orientation as complete when both scans are registered.

      QR code generation and attendance tracking eliminate paper-based roll calls and prevent fraudulent attendance claims. Each QR code encodes the booking ID, user ID, and session information in encrypted format, making codes unique and non-transferable. The inspector scanning interface validates QR authenticity in real-time by querying the database, displays attendee information including name and photo for visual verification, and records precise timestamps for check-in and check-out events. This digital attendance system provides administrators with accurate participation records and automates the progression of applications once orientation requirements are satisfied.

      The administrative dashboard provides City Health Office personnel with comprehensive tools for managing the application workflow. Document verification interfaces display uploaded files with thumbnail previews and full-screen zoom capabilities, allowing administrators to carefully review medical results, identification documents, and payment receipts. For each document, administrators can approve with a single click or reject with specific remarks that are visible to applicants, such as "Image too blurry - please resubmit" or "Results expired - must be within 6 months." Common rejection reasons are available as quick-select options to streamline the review process while maintaining clear communication with applicants.

      Payment validation modules track both Maya online transactions and manual receipt uploads, verifying that amounts match expected fees including the ten-peso processing fee, transaction references are valid, and payment dates are recent. Administrators can approve legitimate payments or flag discrepancies for follow-up, with all validation actions logged for audit trails.

      Application review interfaces consolidate all information into single screens where administrators can view personal information, document verification status for all required items, payment confirmation status, orientation completion for Yellow cards, laboratory findings input fields for recording specific medical conditions, and final remarks that explain approval or rejection decisions. Approved applications automatically trigger digital health card generation, while rejections generate detailed notification messages with personalized checklists showing which requirements need attention, suggestions for nearby health centers where additional tests can be conducted, and guidance on the reapplication process.

      Digital health card generation and download represent the culmination of the application process. Upon final approval, the system automatically retrieves applicant photographs, extracts personal information from application records, assigns unique registration numbers following CHO numbering conventions, applies color coding based on classification (yellow, green, or pink background), calculates one-year expiration dates from issue date, and generates unique QR codes encoding registration numbers, issue dates, and verification data. These elements are assembled into HTML templates matching official City Health Office card designs, with the complete HTML stored in the Convex database to preserve exact layout and content for historical accuracy. Users receive push notifications when cards become available and can access the health card section to view, download as images, and share their digital credentials. The embedded QR codes enable quick verification by CHO inspectors during monitoring activities, with inspector interfaces retrieving associated records to display cardholder information, registration numbers, job categories, issue and expiration dates, and card status indicators showing whether cards are active, expired, or revoked.

System Evaluation and Testing

      The eMediCard prototype underwent comprehensive evaluation and testing to ensure functionality, reliability, and user experience met project requirements and quality standards. The evaluation process combined automated testing procedures with manual user acceptance testing involving representative users from both applicant and administrative perspectives.

      Functional testing verified that each system module performed its intended operations correctly. User registration and authentication testing confirmed that email verification links were delivered successfully, invalid email formats were rejected with appropriate error messages, password requirements were enforced (minimum length, complexity), and duplicate registrations were prevented. Application submission testing validated that classification selection properly triggered correct document checklists, file uploads accepted valid formats while rejecting invalid types, progress indicators accurately reflected completion status, and submission was blocked when required documents were missing.

      Integration testing assessed communication and data flow between system components. Mobile-to-backend integration tests confirmed that data entered in mobile forms was correctly stored in Convex database, real-time updates from administrative actions propagated to mobile clients without delays, and authentication tokens were properly validated for secure access. Backend-to-Clerk integration tests verified that user registration created corresponding Clerk accounts, email verification status synchronized between Clerk and Convex, and session management worked correctly across application restarts. Maya payment integration tests (conducted in sandbox mode during development) confirmed that payment initiation redirected to Maya interface correctly, payment confirmation callbacks updated application status, and payment failures were handled gracefully with appropriate user notifications.

      System testing evaluated overall performance, security, and scalability. Performance tests measured application launch times, screen transition speeds, document upload durations for various file sizes, and dashboard loading times with different data volumes. Results confirmed that the application remained responsive even when handling multiple simultaneous document uploads and that dashboard interfaces loaded administrative data efficiently even with hundreds of pending applications. Security testing verified that authentication tokens expired appropriately, unauthorized API requests were rejected, file uploads were scanned for malicious content, and sensitive data such as medical documents was transmitted over encrypted connections.

      User acceptance testing involved representative users from the target demographic, including employees who would apply for health cards and CHO staff who would use administrative interfaces. Applicants tested the complete workflow from registration through digital card download, providing feedback on interface clarity, form usability, document upload experience, and notification usefulness. Administrative users tested document verification workflows, payment validation processes, orientation scheduling, and application approval procedures, evaluating efficiency improvements compared to manual processes and identifying any workflow bottlenecks.

      Testing results demonstrated that the eMediCard prototype successfully met all functional and non-functional requirements defined during the requirements gathering phase. The system effectively reduced manual processing workload for CHO staff, provided applicants with transparent status tracking and clear guidance throughout the process, maintained data security and integrity across all operations, and demonstrated scalability to handle peak application volumes during renewal periods. Minor usability refinements identified during testing were addressed before final deployment, including improved error message clarity, enhanced document preview capabilities in the admin dashboard, and optimized notification timing to avoid overwhelming users with excessive alerts.

      Overall, the prototype evaluation confirmed that eMediCard provides a viable digital alternative to traditional health card processing, offering significant efficiency improvements while maintaining the security and compliance standards required for handling sensitive health information. The successful completion of testing validated the system's readiness for deployment and its potential to transform health card management operations in Davao City.
