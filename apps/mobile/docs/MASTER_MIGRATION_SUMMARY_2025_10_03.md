# Master Branch Migration Summary - October 3, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the major architectural migration from `migrationv5` branch to `master`. This represents a complete refactoring of the mobile app to follow Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture.

## Key Changes

### 1. Architecture Migration to FSD
- Complete restructuring from traditional folder structure to Feature-Sliced Design
- New layer-based organization: `app-layer`, `entities`, `features`, `widgets`, `shared`, `processes`
- Improved code organization and separation of concerns

### 2. Major File Structure Changes
- **Deleted**: Old component structure under `src/components/`
- **Moved**: Components reorganized into features and widgets
- **New**: Widget-based architecture for main screens
- **Routing**: Updated to use Expo Router with new file structure

### 3. New Features Added
- Document upload improvements with rejection handling
- View documents functionality with backend integration
- Improved payment flow integration
- Enhanced application detail and list screens

### 4. File Movement Summary
- `src/components/` → Split into `src/features/`, `src/widgets/`, and `src/shared/components/`
- `src/hooks/` → Distributed to relevant features (e.g., `src/features/auth/hooks/`)
- `src/utils/` → Moved to `src/shared/utils/` and feature-specific utils
- `src/styles/` → Moved to `src/shared/styles/`
- `src/types/` → Distributed across entities and features

### 5. Breaking Changes for Team Members

#### Import Path Changes
All imports need to be updated to reflect the new structure:
- `@/src/components/...` → `@/src/shared/components/...` or `@/src/features/.../components/...`
- `@/src/hooks/...` → `@/src/features/.../hooks/...`
- `@/src/utils/...` → `@/src/shared/utils/...`

#### Component Locations
- Authentication components: `src/features/auth/components/`
- Dashboard components: `src/features/dashboard/components/`
- Application components: `src/features/application/components/`
- Common UI components: `src/shared/components/`

#### Screen Components
- Tab screens: `src/screens/tabs/`
- Auth screens: `src/screens/auth/`
- Shared screens: `src/screens/shared/`
- Inspector screens: `src/screens/inspector/`

### 6. New Conventions

#### File Naming
- Components: PascalCase folders with index.ts exports
- Hooks: camelCase files starting with 'use'
- Types: Distributed to relevant feature/entity model folders
- Styles: Component.styles.ts files colocated with components

#### Import Aliases
- `@shared` → `src/shared`
- `@features` → `src/features`
- `@entities` → `src/entities`
- `@widgets` → `src/widgets`

### 7. Migration Steps for Team Members

1. **Pull the latest master branch after merge**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   ```

2. **Clean install dependencies**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Clear any local caches**
   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

4. **Update VS Code to recognize new paths**
   - Restart VS Code after pulling changes
   - TypeScript server will need to reindex

### 8. Testing the Migration

Run these commands to verify everything works:
```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Start development server
npm start
```

### 9. Known Issues & Solutions

- **Import errors**: Update all import paths to new structure
- **Type errors**: Some types have moved to entity model folders
- **Style imports**: Theme imports now from `@shared/styles/theme`

### 10. Benefits of This Migration

- ✅ Better code organization and maintainability
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to find and modify features
- ✅ Improved type safety with distributed types
- ✅ Better scalability for future features

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues after this migration:
1. Check the docs folder for detailed migration guides
2. Search for the component/hook in the new structure
3. Refer to the FSD architecture documentation in `docs/FSD_ARCHITECTURE.md`
