# FSD Migration Phase 4 Summary

## ✅ Phase 4 Complete: Import Updates and Backward Compatibility Removal

### What Was Done

#### 1. **Updated All Imports Across the Codebase**

**Files Updated (12 files):**
1. `src/screens/shared/DocumentRequirementsScreen.tsx`
   - `useJobCategories` → `@entities/jobCategory`
   - Health card utils → `@features/healthCards/lib`

2. `src/app-layer/providers/ClerkAndConvexProvider.tsx`
   - `useUsers` → `@entities/user`

3. `src/screens/inspector/InspectorDashboardScreen.tsx`
   - `useUsers` → `@entities/user`

4. `src/screens/application/ApplyScreen/ApplyScreen.tsx`
   - `useJobCategories` → `@entities/jobCategory`
   - `useApplications` → `@features/application`
   - `useRequirements` → `@features/upload`
   - `useUsers` → `@entities/user`

5. `src/screens/notification/NotificationScreen.tsx`
   - `useNotifications` → `@features/notification`

6. `src/screens/profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`
   - `useUsers` → `@entities/user`

7. `src/screens/shared/PaymentScreen.tsx`
   - `usePayments` → `@features/payment`
   - `useApplications` → `@features/application`

8. `src/screens/shared/HealthCardsScreen.tsx`
   - `useHealthCards` → `@features/healthCards`
   - Health card utils → `@features/healthCards/lib`

9. `src/screens/shared/ActivityScreen.tsx`
   - Activity utils → `@entities/activity/lib`

10. `src/features/dashboard/components/ApplicationStatus/ApplicationStatus.tsx`
    - Job category utils → `@entities/jobCategory/lib`

11. `src/screens/inspector/ReviewApplicationsScreen.tsx`
    - `useUsers` → `@entities/user`

12. `src/screens/shared/UploadDocumentsScreen.tsx`
    - `useApplications` → `@features/application`
    - `useRequirements` → `@features/upload`

13. `app/(screens)/(inspector)/_layout.tsx`
    - `useUsers` → `@entities/user`

14. `app/index.tsx`
    - `useUsers` → `@entities/user`

#### 2. **Removed Backward Compatibility Re-exports**

**Files Cleaned:**
1. `src/shared/hooks/index.ts`
   - Removed all re-exports of migrated hooks
   - Added documentation of where hooks were moved
   - Only generic/utility hooks remain

2. `src/shared/utils/index.ts`
   - Removed all re-exports of migrated utilities
   - Added documentation of where utilities were moved
   - Only generic utilities remain (responsive, user-utils)

### Migration Summary

#### Hooks Migration:
- **Entity Hooks:**
  - `useUsers` → `@entities/user`
  - `useJobCategories` → `@entities/jobCategory`

- **Feature Hooks:**
  - `useApplications` → `@features/application`
  - `usePayments` → `@features/payment`
  - `useHealthCards` → `@features/healthCards`
  - `useRequirements` → `@features/upload`
  - `useNotifications` → `@features/notification`
  - `useVerification` → `@features/scanner`

#### Utilities Migration:
- **Health Card Utils** → `@features/healthCards/lib`
- **Job Category Utils** → `@entities/jobCategory/lib`
- **Activity Utils** → `@entities/activity/lib`
- **Orientation Utils** → `@features/orientation/lib`

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Proper FSD Architecture**: Business logic is now correctly separated into features and entities
2. **Clear Import Paths**: All imports now directly reference their correct FSD locations
3. **No Circular Dependencies**: Removed all backward compatibility re-exports
4. **Better Maintainability**: Each feature/entity owns its business logic
5. **Improved Developer Experience**: Clear understanding of where code lives

### What Remains in Shared

Only truly generic/reusable code:
- **Hooks**: `useStorage`, `useNetwork`, `useDeepLink`, `useDocumentUpload`, `useRoleBasedNavigation`
- **Utils**: Responsive utilities, generic user formatting utilities
- **Components**: Generic UI components
- **Styles**: Theme and styling
- **Services**: Generic storage services

### Next Steps

1. Run tests to ensure everything works after the refactoring
2. Update any documentation that references old import paths
3. Consider creating a migration guide for other developers
4. Monitor for any runtime errors related to import changes
