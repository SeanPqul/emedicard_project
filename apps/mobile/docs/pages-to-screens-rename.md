# Pages to Screens Rename Summary

## What Was Changed

Successfully renamed the `pages` layer to `screens` to better reflect mobile app conventions.

### Changes Made:

1. **Directory Rename**
   - `src/pages/` â†’ `src/screens/`
   - All subdirectories and files preserved

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated `FSD_ARCHITECTURE.md` to reference "Screens Layer" instead of "Pages Layer"
   - Changed all references from "pages" to "screens" in documentation
   - Updated layer descriptions to use "screen components" terminology

3. **Code Updates**
   - Updated import in `OtpInputUI.tsx` from `@/src/pages/` to `@/src/screens/`
   - No other code imports needed updating (good isolation!)

4. **Configuration**
   - `tsconfig.json` already had `@screens/*` path alias configured
   - No changes needed to path aliases

### Files Modified:
- `src/FSD_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `src/features/auth/components/OtpInput/OtpInputUI.tsx`
- `docs/fsd-migration-final-report.md`
- `docs/fsd-inventory.json`

### Result:
The project now uses mobile-appropriate terminology with `screens` instead of `pages`, maintaining consistency with React Native and mobile development conventions.
