Implementation Plan

      The implementation plan for eMediCard: A Mobile-Based Health Card Management System outlines the strategic approach for deploying the system within the City Health Office of Davao City. This plan describes the deployment architecture, infrastructure requirements, major implementation tasks, site-specific considerations, and transition strategy necessary to ensure successful system adoption and operational continuity.

System Overview

      The eMediCard system consists of two primary components requiring coordinated deployment: the mobile application for health card applicants and the web-based administrative dashboard for City Health Office personnel. The mobile application enables employees to register, submit applications, upload documents, make payments, track status, and download digital health cards, while the administrative dashboard provides CHO staff with tools to validate documents, verify payments, manage orientations, and approve applications. Both components rely on cloud-based backend services including Convex for database management, Clerk for authentication, and Maya for payment processing, eliminating the need for on-premises server infrastructure while ensuring scalability and reliability.

Major Tasks in Implementation

Server and Database Configuration

      The implementation begins with configuring the Convex deployment environment for production use. This involves creating a production deployment separate from the development environment, configuring database schema and indexes to optimize query performance for expected user volumes, setting up automated backup procedures to prevent data loss, and establishing proper access controls and API keys for secure communication between client applications and backend services. Convex's serverless architecture eliminates traditional server maintenance requirements, but proper configuration of function permissions and query optimization ensures efficient operation under peak loads during health card renewal periods.

      Database migration procedures transfer initial reference data including job category definitions with their corresponding document requirements, orientation venue and instructor information, and administrator account credentials. Data validation scripts confirm that all required reference tables are properly populated and that relationships between tables maintain referential integrity.

Backend and Mobile Application Deployment

      The mobile application undergoes build and deployment through Expo Application Services (EAS) Build, which generates production-ready Android application packages (APK and AAB formats). The build process includes configuring production API endpoints pointing to the Convex production deployment, embedding production Clerk authentication credentials, integrating Maya payment gateway production credentials (replacing sandbox credentials used during development), setting appropriate application version numbers and build identifiers, and configuring push notification certificates for delivery through Expo's notification service.

      Once built, the Android application package is distributed through direct installation files (APK) provided to CHO staff for distribution to applicants, with future iterations potentially including Google Play Store distribution for wider accessibility. Installation instructions and minimum system requirements are documented in user guides provided to applicants.

Authentication Service Configuration

      Clerk authentication requires production environment configuration including creating a production Clerk application instance separate from development, configuring email templates for verification messages and password resets with appropriate branding, setting up email sender domains to ensure verification emails are delivered reliably and not flagged as spam, defining authentication flow settings such as session duration and password complexity requirements, and integrating Clerk production API keys with the Convex backend to enable secure user authentication across the system.

Testing and Quality Assurance

      Before full deployment, comprehensive testing validates system functionality in the production environment. Acceptance testing with CHO staff confirms that administrative workflows operate correctly, document verification interfaces display uploaded files properly, payment validation accurately identifies legitimate transactions, orientation scheduling creates sessions that appear correctly in the mobile application, and application approval triggers health card generation as expected.

      User acceptance testing with representative applicants verifies that the mobile application installs successfully on various Android devices, registration and email verification complete without errors, document uploads succeed for different file types and sizes, payment processing through Maya functions correctly, and digital health cards download and display properly. Any issues identified during acceptance testing are addressed before proceeding to full deployment.

      Load testing simulates expected peak usage scenarios, such as multiple applicants submitting documents simultaneously during January renewal periods, to confirm that the system maintains acceptable performance under high concurrent user loads. Testing validates that the Convex database handles query volumes efficiently, file uploads remain responsive when multiple users upload documents concurrently, and real-time status updates propagate without excessive delays.

User Training and Orientation

      Successful implementation requires comprehensive training for City Health Office personnel who will manage the system daily. Training sessions cover administrative dashboard navigation and key features, document verification procedures including approval and rejection workflows, payment validation processes for both Maya transactions and manual receipts, orientation scheduling creation and management, application review and approval procedures, troubleshooting common issues such as failed document uploads or payment discrepancies, and report generation for monitoring application volumes and processing times.

      Training materials include step-by-step user guides with screenshots, video tutorials demonstrating common tasks, quick reference cards for frequently used functions, and contact information for technical support during the initial implementation period. Hands-on practice sessions allow administrators to perform typical workflows using test data before processing actual applications.

      For applicants, user orientation materials are distributed through CHO communication channels, including social media posts, informational flyers at health centers and popular venues, and orientation sessions at workplaces with high concentrations of health card holders. These materials explain how to download and install the mobile application, complete registration and email verification, select appropriate classification and upload required documents, make payments through Maya or submit manual receipts, and track application status and download digital health cards.

Site-Specific Requirements

      The eMediCard implementation requires specific site infrastructure and connectivity capabilities to ensure smooth operation within City Health Office workflows.

      Internet connectivity is essential for all system operations, as both mobile clients and web dashboards rely on real-time communication with cloud-based backend services. CHO offices require stable internet connections with adequate bandwidth to support multiple administrators simultaneously reviewing documents, validating payments, and approving applications. Mobile applicants require internet connectivity during registration, document upload, payment processing, and health card download, though viewing previously downloaded information does not require active connections.

      Android device availability among the target user population determines implementation scope. While the system was designed for Android devices running version 8.0 or higher, user surveys and CHO records indicate that the majority of health card applicants own smartphones meeting these requirements. For applicants without compatible devices, CHO offices may provide assistance stations where staff help users complete applications using shared tablets, ensuring accessibility for all applicants regardless of personal device ownership.

      The web-based administrative dashboard requires CHO offices to provide desktop computers or laptops with modern web browsers for staff members responsible for document verification, payment validation, and application processing. Existing CHO computer equipment generally meets these requirements, though older systems may require browser updates to ensure compatibility with dashboard features.

      Orientation venues require inspector personnel to have mobile devices capable of scanning QR codes, such as Android or iOS smartphones with camera functionality and QR scanning applications. These devices access the inspector interface through web browsers, eliminating the need for specialized scanning hardware while providing real-time attendance verification linked directly to the applicant database.

Transition Strategy

      The transition from manual health card processing to the eMediCard system follows a phased approach to minimize disruption and allow for gradual adoption.

      During the initial pilot phase, the system operates in parallel with existing manual processes for a limited user group, such as applicants from specific employers or industry sectors. This controlled deployment allows CHO staff to familiarize themselves with system operations, identifies any remaining issues requiring adjustment, and demonstrates system benefits before full-scale rollout. Pilot participants provide feedback on user experience, identify areas requiring additional documentation or training, and validate that the system meets operational needs.

      Following successful pilot completion, the system transitions to full deployment where all new applications and renewals are processed through eMediCard. Existing manual processes are phased out gradually, with clear communication to applicants about the transition timeline and new procedures. CHO staff continue processing any in-flight manual applications to completion while directing new applicants exclusively to the digital system.

      Throughout the transition period, technical support is readily available to address questions, troubleshoot issues, and assist both applicants and administrators in adapting to new workflows. Regular monitoring of system performance, user feedback, and processing metrics informs ongoing refinements and optimizations to enhance system effectiveness and user satisfaction.
