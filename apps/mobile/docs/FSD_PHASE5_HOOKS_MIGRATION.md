# FSD Migration Phase 5: Final Hooks Migration

## âœ… Phase 5 Complete: Remaining Hooks Moved to Features

### Overview
This phase completed the FSD migration by moving the last remaining business logic hooks from shared to their appropriate features.

### Hooks Migrated

#### 1. **useOptimizedDashboard â†’ @features/dashboard/hooks**
- **File**: `src/shared/hooks/useOptimizedDashboard.ts` â†’ `src/features/dashboard/hooks/useOptimizedDashboard.ts`
- **Why**: Contains dashboard-specific business logic including:
  - Dashboard stats calculation
  - Recent activities aggregation
  - Job categories caching
  - Greeting logic
- **Used by**: `useDashboardData` hook in the same feature

#### 2. **useRoleBasedNavigation â†’ @features/navigation/hooks** (New Feature Created)
- **File**: `src/shared/hooks/useRoleBasedNavigation.ts` â†’ `src/features/navigation/hooks/useRoleBasedNavigation.ts`
- **Why**: Manages navigation permissions and role-based access control
- **New feature structure created**:
  ```
  src/features/navigation/
    â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useRoleBasedNavigation.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ model/ (ready for future types)
    â”œâ”€â”€ ui/ (ready for RoleBasedTabLayout move)
    â””â”€â”€ index.ts
  ```
- **Used by**: 
  - `RoleBasedTabLayout` component
  - Inspector screens for access control

#### 3. **useDocumentUpload â†’ @features/upload/hooks**
- **File**: `src/shared/hooks/useDocumentUpload.ts` â†’ `src/features/upload/hooks/useDocumentUpload.ts`
- **Why**: Handles document upload functionality including:
  - File upload management
  - Caching with MMKV
  - Batch uploads
  - Retry logic
- **Used by**: 
  - `UploadDocumentsScreen`
  - Payment flow process

### Files Updated (6 files)

1. **src/features/dashboard/hooks/index.ts**
   - Added export for `useOptimizedDashboard`

2. **src/features/dashboard/hooks/useDashboardData.ts**
   - Updated import from `@shared/hooks` to relative import

3. **src/features/upload/hooks/index.ts**
   - Added export for `useDocumentUpload`

4. **src/shared/navigation/RoleBasedTabLayout.tsx**
   - Updated import to `@features/navigation`

5. **src/screens/inspector/InspectorDashboardScreen.tsx**
   - Updated import to `@features/navigation`

6. **src/screens/inspector/ReviewApplicationsScreen.tsx**
   - Updated import to `@features/navigation`

7. **src/screens/shared/UploadDocumentsScreen.tsx**
   - Updated import to `@features/upload`

8. **src/processes/paymentFlow/model/hooks.ts**
   - Updated import to `@features/upload`

9. **src/shared/hooks/index.ts**
   - Removed exports for migrated hooks
   - Added documentation of where hooks were moved

### What Remains in Shared

Only truly generic hooks now remain in shared:
- `useStorage` - Generic storage operations
- `useDeepLink` - Generic deep linking
- `useNetwork` - Generic network status
- `useNetworkStatus` - Generic network monitoring

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Complete FSD Compliance**: All business logic is now properly encapsulated in features/entities
2. **Clear Separation**: Shared folder only contains truly reusable, non-business-specific code
3. **Better Feature Cohesion**: Each feature now owns all its related logic
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between features

### Next Recommended Steps

1. **Move Navigation Components**: Consider moving `RoleBasedTabLayout` to `@features/navigation/ui`
2. **Consolidate Health Card Features**: Merge `health-card` and `healthCards` features
3. **Move File Upload Utilities**: Move `fileUploadUtils.ts` to `@features/upload/lib`
4. **Create Missing Models**: Add model directories to features that lack them
5. **Move Document Cache**: Move document cache service to upload feature

### Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The FSD architecture migration is now complete for hooks. All business logic has been properly organized into features and entities, with shared containing only generic utilities.
