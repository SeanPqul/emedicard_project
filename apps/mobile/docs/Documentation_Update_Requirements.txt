   CHANGE: "Visual Studio Code" and "Android Studio"
   TO: "Visual Studio Code" (keep) and add "Expo Go app for testing"
   REMOVE: Android Studio mention (unless still needed for specific Android testing)

3. DATABASE METHODOLOGY
   CHANGE: "Firebase Firestore"
   TO: "Convex" (real-time database with serverless backend)
   REMOVE: All mentions of "Firestore Emulator", "Firestore security rules", "Firestore indexing"
   ADD: Convex schema definitions, Convex functions (queries/mutations/actions)

4. AUTHENTICATION
   CHANGE: "Firebase Authentication"
   TO: "Clerk" (authentication and user management)
   ADD: Description of Clerk features being used (social auth, email/password, session management)

5. STORAGE/FILE UPLOADS
   CHANGE: "Firebase Storage"
   TO: Either "Convex File Storage" or specify if using third-party service (e.g., Cloudinary, AWS S3)
   UPDATE: Document upload methodology accordingly

6. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
   REMOVE: "integrate Firebase services"
   ADD: "integrate Clerk authentication SDK", "implement Convex backend functions", "configure Expo app.json"
   REMOVE: "security rules for Firestore"
   ADD: "Convex function permissions and authentication checks"

7. TESTING METHODOLOGY
   REMOVE: "Firestore Emulator" testing
   ADD: "Convex development deployment for testing"
   UPDATE: Testing approach for React Native (Jest, React Native Testing Library)

8. DEPLOYMENT PHASE
   KEEP: "Android App Bundle (AAB)" via Google Play
   ADD: "Expo Application Services (EAS) Build for building production apps"
   REMOVE: "Firebase Crashlytics and Google Analytics"
   ADD: Alternative monitoring (e.g., "Sentry for error tracking", "Expo Analytics" or specify what you're using)

9. MAINTENANCE PHASE
   REMOVE: "Firebase Crashlytics and Google Analytics"
   REMOVE: "updates to Firestore rules or third-party SDKs"
   ADD: "updates to Convex schema and functions", "Clerk configuration updates", "Expo SDK updates"

10. SOFTWARE STABLE RELEASE VERSIONS
    REMOVE: "Flutter SDK — 3.29.3"
    ADD: "React Native — [current version]", "Expo SDK — [current version]"
    REMOVE: "Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) — Managed via Firebase Console"
    ADD: "Clerk — [version/plan]", "Convex — [version/plan]"
    REMOVE: "Android Emulator (via Android Studio) — 35.5.10"
    UPDATE TO: "Expo Go app / Android Emulator — [version]"

11. DATA MODEL/ARCHITECTURE
    CHANGE: All "Firestore collections" references
    TO: "Convex tables"
    UPDATE: Collection/document structure terminology to Convex schema (tables, documents, indexes)
    CHANGE: NoSQL reference from "Firestore" to "Convex (NoSQL/document-based)"

12. CI/CD PIPELINE
    UPDATE: Continuous integration references
    ADD: "EAS Build for automated builds", "EAS Submit for store submissions"
    SPECIFY: Testing framework changes (Flutter tests → Jest/React Native Testing Library)

13. REAL-TIME FEATURES
    UPDATE: How real-time updates work
    CHANGE FROM: Firebase real-time listeners
    TO: Convex reactive queries (explain how Convex automatically updates UI)

14. PUSH NOTIFICATIONS (if documented)
    REMOVE: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) if mentioned directly
    ADD: Expo Push Notifications or native FCM integration via React Native

15. QR CODE IMPLEMENTATION
    UPDATE: Any Flutter-specific QR libraries
    TO: React Native QR code libraries (e.g., react-native-qrcode-svg, expo-barcode-scanner)

16. DATABASE SCHEMA AND STRUCTURE (Page 46, Figure 33)
    CHANGE: "Firestore collections (COL), documents (DOC), and subcollections (SUBCOL)"
    TO: "Convex tables and documents"
    UPDATE: Schema terminology throughout:
      - Collections → Tables
      - Documents → Documents (remains same)
      - Subcollections → Nested document arrays or separate related tables
    
    SPECIFIC COLLECTIONS TO UPDATE:
    - "user profiles collection" → "users table"
    - "application records collection" → "applications table"
    - "document metadata collection" → "documents table"
    - "payment transactions collection" → "payments table"
    - "orientation schedules collection" → "schedules table"
    
    UPDATE: Schema diagram (Figure 33) to reflect Convex table structure
    UPDATE: All references to "NoSQL database (Firestore)" to "NoSQL database (Convex)"
    ADD: Explanation of Convex schema definitions and how relationships work in Convex

========================================================================
SUMMARY
-------
Total Sections to Update: 16 major sections
Scope: Architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance
Impact: Affects entire technical documentation throughout the document

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Pay special attention to Figure 33 (Page 46) - the database schema diagram
- Update all "COL", "DOC", "SUBCOL" terminology to Convex equivalents
- Five main collections need renaming: users, applications, documents, 
  payments, and schedules

Please ensure all Firebase and Flutter references are replaced with the
corresponding React Native/Expo/Clerk/Convex equivalents.
