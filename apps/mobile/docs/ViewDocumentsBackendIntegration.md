# View Documents Backend Integration Summary

**Date:** January 3, 2025  
**Feature:** Backend Integration for Document Viewing

## Backend Changes

### 1. Enhanced Authentication in getFormDocumentsRequirements
**File:** `C:\Em\backend\convex\requirements\getFormDocumentsRequirements.ts`

**Added:**
- User authentication check to ensure users can only view their own documents
- Verification that the application belongs to the authenticated user
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

```typescript
// Get current user identity
const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
if (!identity) {
  throw new Error("Not authenticated");
}

// Ensure the application belongs to the current user
if (application.userId !== user._id) {
  throw new Error("Unauthorized: You can only view your own documents");
}
```

### 2. Added Storage URL Fetching
**Added file URLs to returned documents:**
```typescript
const fileUrl = await ctx.storage.getUrl(doc.storageFileId);
return {
  ...doc,
  requirement,
  fileUrl, // Include the URL for viewing
};
```

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Complete Document Viewer
**Features:**
- Modal-based document viewer
- Support for both images and PDFs
- Image zoom functionality (pinch-to-zoom)
- PDF preview with "Open in Browser" option
- Direct file URL access from Convex storage

### 2. Document Display Features
- Shows original filename (preserved from upload)
- Review status badges (Pending/Approved/Rejected)
- Admin remarks when available
- Upload date
- Document type icon and name

### 3. User Flow
1. User navigates to Application Details
2. Clicks "View Uploaded Documents"
3. Documents are fetched with user authentication
4. Each document displays with:
   - Original filename
   - Review status
   - View button
5. Clicking "View Document":
   - Opens modal viewer
   - Images: Display with zoom capability
   - PDFs: Show preview with browser option
6. Option to open documents in external browser

## Security

✅ **User Authentication**: Only authenticated users can view documents
✅ **Ownership Verification**: Users can only view their own application documents  
✅ **Secure Storage URLs**: URLs are generated server-side through Convex storage API
✅ **No Cross-User Access**: Application ownership is verified before returning data

## Data Flow

1. **Frontend Request**:
   ```typescript
   api.requirements.getFormDocumentsRequirements.getApplicationDocumentsRequirementsQuery
   { applicationId: formId }
   ```

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - Authenticate user
   - Verify application ownership
   - Fetch documents from `documentUploads` table
   - Get storage URLs for each document
   - Return documents with requirements and URLs

3. **Frontend Display**:
   - Render document cards with status
   - Enable viewing through modal
   - Support zoom for images
   - External browser option for all files

## Document Types Supported

- **Images**: JPG, PNG (displayed in modal with zoom)
- **PDFs**: PDF files (preview with browser option)
- All files can be opened in external browser via Linking API

## Benefits

1. **Secure Access**: Documents are only accessible to their owners
2. **Real-time URLs**: Storage URLs are generated on-demand
3. **Full Document Info**: Users see filename, status, and admin feedback
4. **Flexible Viewing**: In-app viewing for images, browser option for all
5. **Professional UI**: Clean modal interface with proper navigation
