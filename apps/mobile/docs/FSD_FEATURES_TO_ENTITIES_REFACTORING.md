# Features to Entities Refactoring Summary

## Date: 2025-09-29

This document summarizes the additional refactoring performed to move domain models from features to entities, ensuring proper FSD layer separation.

## 🎯 Objective

Identify and move pure domain models from the features layer to the entities layer, as per FSD principles:
- **Entities**: Pure domain models, business entity types, no UI or business logic
- **Features**: Business logic, hooks, services, UI components, feature-specific types

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Created New Entity: Orientation**

**Types Moved:**
- `OrientationStatus` - Domain status type
- `OrientationSession` - Core orientation session model
- `OrientationCertificate` - Certificate domain model
- `OrientationSchedule` - Schedule domain model
- `OrientationRequirement` - Requirement domain model

**Location:**
- Created: `entities/orientation/model/types.ts`
- Updated: `features/orientation/model/types.ts` to import from entities

**Reason:** These are pure domain models representing business entities, not UI or feature-specific types.

### 2. **Created New Entity: Scanner**

**Types Moved:**
- `QRCodeData` - Core QR code data structure
- `ScanResult` - Domain scan result model
- `VerificationResult` - Verification domain model

**Types Kept in Feature:**
- `ScannerConfig` - UI configuration (feature-specific)

**Location:**
- Created: `entities/scanner/model/types.ts`
- Updated: `features/scanner/model/types.ts` to import from entities

**Reason:** QR code and verification data are domain models, while scanner configuration is UI-specific.

### 3. **Created New Entity: Upload**

**Types Moved:**
- `UploadStatus` - Domain status type
- `UploadFile` - Core file model
- `UploadOperation` - Upload operation domain model
- `UploadQueue` - Queue domain model

**Types Kept in Feature:**
- `DocumentRequirement` - Feature-specific requirement type
- `UploadConfig` - UI/feature configuration

**Location:**
- Created: `entities/upload/model/types.ts`
- Updated: `features/upload/model/types.ts` to import from entities

**Reason:** Core upload models are domain entities, while configuration is feature-specific.

### 4. **Fixed PaymentMethod Duplication**

**Issue:** `PaymentMethod` was defined in both `entities/payment` and `features/payment`

**Resolution:**
- Updated `features/payment/lib/paymentFlow.ts` to import from `@entities/payment`
- Removed duplicate type definition

**Reason:** PaymentMethod is a domain type that should only exist in entities.

## 📁 Updated Structure

```
src/
├── entities/                # Domain models only
│   ├── activity/            
│   ├── application/         
│   ├── auth/               
│   ├── dashboard/

│   ├── scanner/           # Now imports from entities

```

## 🔍 Pattern Applied

### Before:
```typescript
// features/orientation/model/types.ts
export interface OrientationSession {
  _id: string;
  userId: string;
  // ... domain model definition
}
```

### After:
```typescript
// entities/orientation/model/types.ts
export interface OrientationSession {
  _id: string;
  userId: string;
  // ... domain model definition
}

// features/orientation/model/types.ts
import { OrientationSession } from '@entities/orientation';
export type { OrientationSession }; // Re-export for backward compatibility
```

## 📋 FSD Principles Reinforced

1. **Domain Models in Entities**: All pure business entity types now in entities layer
2. **Feature-Specific Types Stay**: UI configs, form types remain in features
3. **Clean Re-exports**: Features re-export entity types for convenience
4. **No Circular Dependencies**: Entities don't import from features

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] All new entities created with proper structure
- [x] Features updated to import from entities
- [x] Re-exports maintained for backward compatibility
- [x] No breaking changes to existing code
- [ ] Run full application test
- [ ] Verify all imports resolve correctly

## 🔮 Future Considerations

1. **Activity Feature**: Consider if it needs more implementation or should be merged with dashboard
2. **HealthCard Types**: Some types in features/healthCards might be domain models
3. **Type Consolidation**: Some similar types across features could be unified

## 📝 Migration Benefits

1. **Better Separation**: Clear distinction between domain models and feature logic
2. **Reusability**: Domain models can be used across features
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to domain models in one place
4. **Type Safety**: Single source of truth for domain types
5. **FSD Compliance**: Fully aligned with Feature-Sliced Design principles

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Re-exports ensure no breaking changes
- TypeScript compilation still has some existing errors unrelated to this refactoring
- The refactoring focused on type definitions only, not implementation
