# Type Errors Summary After FSD Migration

This document summarizes the remaining TypeScript errors after completing the FSD Extended migration.

## Migration-Related Issues (Resolved)
- ✅ All payment flow imports updated to use `@processes/*`
- ✅ All generic type imports updated to use `@types/*`
- ✅ Compatibility stubs removed
- ✅ Path aliases already configured in tsconfig.json

## Remaining Type Errors (Not Related to Migration)

### 1. Missing Module Errors
- `app/(screens)/(shared)/orientation.tsx`: Cannot find module '../../../src/utils'
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`: Cannot find module '@/src/core/navigation/components/RoleBasedTabLayout'
- `app/providers/ClerkAndConvexProvider.tsx`: Cannot find module '@shared/utils/user-utils'

### 2. Missing Props Errors
Multiple components are missing required navigation props:
- `ApplicationListScreenProps` in `app/(tabs)/application.tsx`
- `ApplyScreenProps` in `app/(tabs)/apply.tsx`
- `ApplicationDetailScreenProps` in `app/application/[id].tsx`
- `FeedbackSystemProps` in payment screens (cancelled, failed, success)

### 3. Type Declaration Issues
- `navigation-debug.tsx`: String | undefined not assignable to string
- `orientation.tsx`: Variable 'orientations' implicitly has type 'any[]'
- `docs/types/index.ts`: Multiple missing type declarations (UserService, ApplicationService, etc.)

## Recommended Actions

1. **Fix Missing Modules**: 
   - Check if utils module exists or needs to be created
   - Verify RoleBasedTabLayout component location
   - Ensure user-utils exists in shared/utils

2. **Add Navigation Props**: 
   - Update screen components to properly type navigation props
   - Consider using React Navigation's typed hooks

3. **Clean Up docs/types**: 
   - The docs/types folder seems to contain old type definitions
   - Consider if this should be removed or updated

4. **Type Safety**: 
   - Fix implicit any types
   - Add proper null checks for optional values

## Migration Success
The FSD Extended migration itself is complete. The remaining errors are pre-existing issues not caused by the migration.
