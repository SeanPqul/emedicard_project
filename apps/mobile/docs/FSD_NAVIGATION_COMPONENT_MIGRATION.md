# Navigation Component Migration

## ✅ RoleBasedTabLayout Moved to Navigation Feature

### Overview
Completed the migration of `RoleBasedTabLayout` component from shared to the navigation feature, following FSD principles where UI components should be co-located with their business logic.

### Migration Details

#### Component Moved
- **From**: `src/shared/navigation/RoleBasedTabLayout.tsx`
- **To**: `src/features/navigation/ui/RoleBasedTabLayout.tsx`

#### Why This Migration
- The component uses `useRoleBasedNavigation` hook from the same feature
- It implements role-based navigation logic, which is feature-specific
- Follows FSD principle: UI components should live with their business logic

### Files Updated

1. **src/features/navigation/ui/RoleBasedTabLayout.tsx**
   - Updated import of `useRoleBasedNavigation` to use relative path: `'../hooks'`

2. **src/features/navigation/ui/index.ts** (Created)
   - Added barrel export for UI components

3. **src/features/navigation/index.ts**
   - Added export for `RoleBasedTabLayout` from './ui'

4. **app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx**
   - Updated import from `'../../src/shared/navigation/RoleBasedTabLayout'`
   - To: `import { RoleBasedTabLayout } from '@features/navigation'`

### What Remains in Shared/Navigation

Only truly generic navigation types remain:
- `types.ts` - Contains `RootStackParamList`, `NavigationProp`, `RouteProp`, etc.
- These types are used across multiple features and should remain shared

### Navigation Feature Structure

```
src/features/navigation/
├── hooks/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── useRoleBasedNavigation.ts
├── model/
│   └── (ready for navigation-specific types)
├── ui/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── RoleBasedTabLayout.tsx
└── index.ts
```

### Benefits
1. **Feature Cohesion**: Navigation logic and UI are now in the same feature
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Shared only contains generic types
3. **Better Maintainability**: Easy to find all navigation-related code
4. **FSD Compliance**: Follows the principle of co-locating related code

### Next Steps
Consider moving other navigation-related components if any exist in the shared folder.
