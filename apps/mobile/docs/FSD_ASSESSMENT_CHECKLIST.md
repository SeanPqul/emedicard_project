# FSD Assessment Checklist

## 🔍 Quick Assessment for Extended FSD Layers

### Current State Analysis

#### Cross-Feature Dependencies
Let's check if we have cross-feature imports:

```powershell
# Check if features import from other features
Get-ChildItem -Path src/features -Recurse -Include "*.ts","*.tsx" | 
  Select-String -Pattern "from ['\""]@features/(?!$($_.Directory.Parent.Name))" | 
  Group-Object Path | 
  Select-Object Name, Count
```

#### Generic Types Assessment
Current generic types location: `src/shared/types/`
- ✅ utility.ts (generic utility types)
- ✅ navigation.ts (routing types)
- ✅ design-system.ts (UI types)
- ❌ Currently mixed with domain concepts

#### Payment Flow Usage
- Currently in: `src/features/payment/hooks/usePaymentFlow.ts`
- Exported from: `src/shared/hooks/index.ts`
- Used by: Multiple features? (needs verification)

### Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Standard FSD (6) | Extended FSD (8) | Your Project |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Project Size** | Small-Medium | Large | Medium-Large |
| **Team Size** | 1-5 devs | 5+ devs | ? |
| **Cross-feature flows** | Few | Many | Payment, Application |
| **Generic types volume** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Domain complexity** | Simple | Complex | Medium-High |
| **Expected growth** | Stable | Rapid | Growing |

### Questions to Answer

1. **Do you have workflows that span multiple features?**
   - [ ] Payment process (apply → pay → verify)
   - [ ] Application workflow (create → review → approve)
   - [ ] User onboarding (register → verify → setup)

2. **How many truly generic types do you have?**
   - [ ] More than 20 generic utility types?
   - [ ] Complex type utilities (Result<T>, Maybe<T>)?
   - [ ] Shared API response wrappers?

3. **Is payment flow really cross-feature?**
   - [ ] Used by application feature?
   - [ ] Used by dashboard feature?
   - [ ] Used by profile feature?

4. **Future workflows planned?**
   - [ ] Document verification flow?
   - [ ] Health card issuance flow?
   - [ ] Inspector review process?

### My Analysis of Your Code

Based on what I've seen:

1. **Payment Flow**: 
   - Used in application submission
   - Shown in dashboard
   - Tracked in profile
   - ✅ Qualifies as cross-feature process

2. **Generic Types**:
   - You have utility types
   - Navigation types
   - API types
   - ✅ Enough to warrant separate layer

3. **Project Complexity**:
   - Multiple user roles
   - Multi-step workflows
   - Cross-feature dependencies
   - ✅ Benefits from extended structure

## 📊 Recommendation Score

**Standard FSD (6 layers)**: 6/10
- ✅ Simpler structure
- ✅ Less decision fatigue
- ❌ Payment flow doesn't fit well
- ❌ Generic types mixed with shared

**Extended FSD (8 layers)**: 8/10
- ✅ Clear home for payment flow
- ✅ Better type organization
- ✅ Room for growth
- ✅ Matches your complexity
- ❌ Slightly more complex

## 🎯 Final Verdict

**I recommend the Extended FSD (8 layers)** for your project because:

1. You already have a clear cross-feature process (payment)
2. Your generic types deserve their own layer
3. The project is complex enough to benefit
4. It provides better scalability

The extra complexity is minimal and the benefits are significant for your use case.

## 📋 Quick Migration Path

If you decide to proceed:

1. **Week 1**: Add processes/ and types/ directories
2. **Week 2**: Move payment flow to processes/
3. **Week 3**: Move generic types to types/
4. **Week 4**: Update imports and documentation

No breaking changes needed - use compatibility stubs!
