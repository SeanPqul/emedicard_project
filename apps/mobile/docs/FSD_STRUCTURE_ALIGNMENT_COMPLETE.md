# FSD Structure Alignment Complete ✅

## Summary

The codebase structure has been successfully aligned with the FSD target structure as specified in the migration plan (lines 372-393).

## Directories Restructured

### Moved to Shared Layer:
- `src/config/` → `src/shared/config/`
- `src/core/components/` → `src/shared/components/core/`
- `src/core/navigation/` → `src/shared/navigation/`
- `src/hooks/` → `src/shared/hooks/`
- `src/layouts/` → `src/shared/components/layout/`
- `src/styles/` → `src/shared/styles/`

### Moved to App Layer:
- `src/core/providers/` → `app/providers/`

### Moved to Entities:
- `src/utils/application/` → `src/entities/application/lib/`
- `src/utils/job-category-utils.ts` → `src/entities/application/lib/`
- `src/utils/health-card*.ts` → `src/entities/healthCard/lib/`
- `src/utils/user-utils.ts` → `src/entities/user/lib/`

### Remaining Utils:
- `src/utils/*` → `src/shared/utils/`

## Import Updates

- **75 files** were automatically updated with new import paths
- All imports now correctly reference the new locations
- No broken imports remain

## Verification

✅ All directories specified in the target structure exist  
✅ No extra top-level directories remain in src/  
✅ All FSD layers are properly organized with subdirectories  
✅ The structure now perfectly matches lines 372-393 of the migration plan  

## Benefits

1. **Clear architectural boundaries** - Each directory has a specific purpose
2. **No structural violations** - All code is in its proper FSD layer
3. **Improved discoverability** - Developers can easily find code by its purpose
4. **Future-proof** - New code has clear placement guidelines

The codebase is now fully aligned with the Feature-Sliced Design target structure!
