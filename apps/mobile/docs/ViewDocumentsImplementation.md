# View Documents Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 3, 2025  
**Feature:** View Uploaded Documents Screen

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive document viewing system that allows users to view all their uploaded documents regardless of verification status, addressing the issue where users were seeing "Upload Documents" instead of their actual uploaded documents.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Created ViewDocumentsScreen Component
**Location:** `src/screens/shared/ViewDocumentsScreen/ViewDocumentsScreen.tsx`

**Features:**
- Displays all uploaded documents with their verification status
- Shows summary cards with count of uploaded, approved, pending, and rejected documents
- Context-aware status messages based on application status
- Warning card for missing required documents
- Empty state when no documents are uploaded
- Option to upload additional documents
- View button for each document (ready for future implementation of document viewer)

**Status Display Logic:**
- **Pending Payment**: "Documents will be verified after payment is confirmed"
- **Submitted**: "Your documents are waiting for verification by our team"
- **Under Review**: "Your documents are currently being verified"
- **Approved/Rejected**: Contextual messages

### 2. Created Styles File
**Location:** `src/screens/shared/ViewDocumentsScreen/ViewDocumentsScreen.styles.ts`

Comprehensive styling including:
- Header with back navigation
- Summary cards with icon-based statistics
- Info and warning cards with left border accent
- Document cards with icon containers
- Status badges with dynamic coloring
- Responsive sizing using theme utilities

### 3. Route Configuration
**Location:** `app/(screens)/(shared)/documents/view.tsx`

Added new route for viewing documents that integrates with Expo Router navigation system.

### 4. Updated ApplicationDetailWidget
**Location:** `src/widgets/application-detail/ApplicationDetailWidget.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated "Pending Payment" message from "Documents will be available for verification after payment" to "Documents will be verified after payment is confirmed"
- Changed navigation from upload screen to view screen: `/(screens)/(shared)/documents/view?formId=${application._id}`
- Documents section now properly positioned below Application Information section

### 5. Updated Total Amount Color
**Location:** `src/widgets/application-detail/ApplicationDetailWidget.styles.ts`

Changed total amount color from brand secondary color to black (`theme.colors.text.primary`) for better visibility and professional appearance.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
Uses Convex query `api.requirements.getFormDocumentsRequirements.getApplicationDocumentsRequirementsQuery` which returns:
- Application details
- Job category information
- Uploaded documents with requirement details
- Required documents list
- Document counts

### Document Status Colors
- **Approved**: Green (`accent.safetyGreen`)
- **Rejected**: Red (`semantic.error`)
- **Pending**: Orange (`accent.warningOrange`)

### Missing Documents Detection
Automatically detects required documents that haven't been uploaded and displays them in a warning card with a direct link to upload them.

## User Flow

1. User navigates to Application Details
2. User clicks "View Uploaded Documents" button
3. ViewDocumentsScreen displays:
   - Summary of document counts by status
   - Contextual status message
   - Warning for any missing required documents
   - List of all uploaded documents with:
     - Document type icon and name
     - Original filename
     - Upload date
     - Review status badge
     - Admin remarks (if any)
     - View button for each document
4. User can upload additional/missing documents via provided buttons

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users can view their documents at any stage of the application process
2. **Clarity**: Improved messaging clearly explains when verification will occur
3. **Completeness**: Users are immediately notified of missing required documents
4. **Status Awareness**: Visual indicators and messages keep users informed
5. **Accessibility**: Documents are accessible before, during, and after verification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Document Viewer Modal**: Implement full-screen image/PDF viewer when clicking "View Document"
2. **Download Option**: Allow users to download their uploaded documents
3. **Replace Document**: Enable replacing rejected or blur documents directly from this screen
4. **Document Preview Thumbnails**: Show small previews of documents in the list
5. **Filter/Sort Options**: Add ability to filter by status or sort by date

## Files Created

1. `src/screens/shared/ViewDocumentsScreen/ViewDocumentsScreen.tsx`
2. `src/screens/shared/ViewDocumentsScreen/ViewDocumentsScreen.styles.ts`
3. `src/screens/shared/ViewDocumentsScreen/index.ts`
4. `app/(screens)/(shared)/documents/view.tsx`

## Files Modified

1. `src/widgets/application-detail/ApplicationDetailWidget.tsx`
2. `src/widgets/application-detail/ApplicationDetailWidget.styles.ts`

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with no documents uploaded (should show empty state)
2. Test with all documents uploaded and approved
3. Test with some documents pending/rejected
4. Test with missing required documents (should show warning)
5. Test navigation between view and upload screens
6. Test different application statuses (Pending Payment, Submitted, Under Review, etc.)
7. Verify admin remarks display correctly when present
8. Test "Upload Additional Documents" functionality

## Code Quality & Project Patterns

### Pattern Compliance
✅ **Import Patterns**: Follows project conventions:
- `@/src/shared/components/layout/BaseScreenLayout` for layout components
- `@shared/` for shared utilities (theme, components)
- `@features/` for feature-specific hooks and logic
- `@backend/` for Convex API and types

### Removed Unused Code
✅ **Cleaned up imports**:
- Removed unused `useState` hook and `selectedDocument` state
- Removed unused `Alert` import
- Removed unused `Image` import
- Properly ordered imports following project structure

✅ **Replaced Alert with console.log** for document viewing placeholder:
- Changed from `Alert.alert()` to `console.log()` for TODO implementation
- Added clear TODO comment for future enhancement

### TypeScript Validation
✅ Passes TypeScript type checking with no errors
✅ All interfaces properly typed with Convex ID types
✅ Proper type annotations for component props and state

## Notes

- The backend query `getApplicationDocumentsRequirementsQuery` is already implemented and provides all necessary data
- Document viewing (opening the actual file) is ready for future implementation with a TODO comment
- The screen uses existing theme utilities and follows the established design patterns
- All status messages are contextual based on application status
- The implementation maintains consistency with other screens in the application
- Import order and patterns match existing screens (PaymentScreen, HealthCardsScreen, etc.)
