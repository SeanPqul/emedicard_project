# ðŸŽ‰ FSD Migration Complete! 

## Executive Summary

The Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) migration for the Emedicard mobile app has been successfully completed on 2025-09-21. All 9 phases of the migration plan have been executed, transforming the codebase into a well-organized, maintainable architecture.

## Migration Overview

### What is FSD?
Feature-Sliced Design is an architectural methodology that organizes code by business purpose, with clear boundaries between layers:
- **Screens** - Navigation entry points and page compositions
- **Features** - Self-contained business features  
- **Entities** - Core domain objects and business logic
- **Processes** - Cross-feature business flows
- **Shared** - Reusable utilities and components

### Migration Stats
- **Total Phases**: 9
- **Files Updated**: 105+ files
- **Screens Migrated**: 20+ screens
- **Domain Entities Created**: 4 (Application, User, Payment, HealthCard)
- **Archived Directories Removed**: 3

## Completed Phases

### âœ… Phase 1-2: Screens Infrastructure
- Created `src/screens/` directory structure
- Migrated all screen components from route files
- Converted all Expo Router files to thin wrappers (â‰¤10 lines each)

### âœ… Phase 3: Domain Entities
- Established `src/entities/` with domain boundaries
- Moved domain types from `src/types/domain/` to entities
- Relocated domain services and UI components

### âœ… Phase 4: Feature Normalization  
- Ensured features are self-contained
- Removed domain leakage from features
- Features now only import from entities and shared

### âœ… Phase 5: Process Extraction
- Created `src/processes/` for cross-feature flows
- Moved payment flow orchestration to processes

### âœ… Phase 6-7: Shared & Types Cleanup
- Strengthened shared layer organization
- Moved all domain types to entities
- Kept only generic types in `src/types/`

### âœ… Phase 8: Import Path Updates
- Added FSD aliases to tsconfig.json
- Updated 62 files to use new aliases
- Converted 43 files from relative imports
- All imports now use clean FSD paths:
  - `@screens/*`, `@features/*`, `@entities/*`, `@processes/*`, `@shared/*`

### âœ… Phase 9: Legacy Cleanup
- Removed all archived directories
- Cleaned up migration artifacts
- Zero references to legacy code remain

## New Architecture

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/          # Page-level components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ application/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ inspector/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ notification/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ profile/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared/
â”œâ”€â”€ features/         # Business features
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ application/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ payment/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ entities/         # Domain layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ application/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ payment/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ healthCard/
â”œâ”€â”€ processes/        # Business processes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ paymentFlow/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/          # Cross-cutting concerns
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services/
â””â”€â”€ app/             # Expo Router (thin wrappers only)
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Clear Architecture Boundaries**
- Each layer has a specific purpose
- Dependencies flow in one direction
- No circular dependencies

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Easy to locate code by business purpose
- Clear separation of concerns
- Predictable code organization

### 3. **Better Scalability**
- New features have clear placement
- Domain logic is centralized
- Shared code is properly abstracted

### 4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
- Clean import paths with aliases
- Consistent file structure
- Self-documenting architecture

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. **Documentation**: Update developer onboarding docs with FSD structure
2. **Linting**: Add ESLint rules to enforce FSD boundaries
3. **Testing**: Organize tests to mirror FSD structure
4. **CI/CD**: Update build scripts if needed

### Best Practices Going Forward
- Place new screens in `src/screens/`
- Keep features self-contained in `src/features/`
- Add domain logic to appropriate entities
- Use processes for multi-feature flows
- Share only truly cross-cutting code
