# Import Resolution Summary

## Overview
All import errors in the eMediCard mobile app have been successfully resolved. The app now bundles without any import-related issues.

## Fixes Completed

### 1. Mobile Cache Manager
- **Issue**: `Unable to resolve "../../../shared/lib/cache/mobileCacheManager"`
- **Solution**: Created a wrapper around existing cache utilities
- **Files created**:
  - `src/shared/lib/cache/mobileCacheManager.ts` - Wrapper providing expected interface
  - `src/shared/lib/index.ts` - Barrel exports

### 2. Error Handling Utilities  
- **Issue**: Missing `AppError` and `AppErrorType` imports
- **Solution**: Created proper error class and enum
- **Files created**:
  - `src/shared/lib/errors/AppError.ts` - Error class with type enum
  - `src/shared/lib/errors/index.ts` - Exports

### 3. Payment Flow Utilities
- **Issue**: `Unable to resolve "../../../features/payment/lib"`
- **Solution**: Created payment flow utilities
- **Files created**:
  - `src/features/payment/lib/paymentFlow.ts` - Payment submission functions and types
  - `src/features/payment/lib/index.ts` - Exports
- **Updated**: `src/features/payment/index.ts` to export lib

### 4. Previously Fixed (from AGENT_HANDOFF)
- Health Cards utilities (features/healthCards/lib)
- Application validation (features/application/lib)
- Requirements mapper (entities/application/lib)
- Form storage utilities
- Network hook updates
- Feature index cleanups

## Current Status

### ✅ Build Status
- **Bundle time**: 2710ms
- **Module count**: 2518 modules
- **Import errors**: 0 (all resolved)

### ⚠️ Runtime Errors
The app now has runtime errors that need to be addressed separately:
```
ERROR  ExceptionsManager should be set up after React DevTools
ERROR  TypeError: property is not writable, js engine: hermes  
ERROR  TypeError: Cannot read property 'default' of undefined, js engine: hermes
```

These are NOT import errors but JavaScript runtime issues.

## Key Principles Followed

### 1. Double-Check Policy
Before creating any file, we:
- Searched in working repo (C:\Em)
- Searched in master reference (C:\Users\User\Desktop\emedicard_project)
- Only created files when missing in both

### 2. FSD Layer Placement
- `entities/*` - Domain types and mappers
- `features/*/lib` - Feature-specific utilities
- `processes/*/lib` - Cross-feature workflows
- `shared/lib/*` - Cross-cutting utilities

### 3. Reuse Over Recreation
- Used existing `cacheUtils` instead of recreating storage
- Wrapped existing functionality when possible
- Maintained compatibility with existing code

## Next Steps
1. Investigate and fix runtime errors
2. Test app functionality once runtime errors are resolved
3. Address any UI/UX issues that may arise
4. Run full type checking to identify type-level issues

## Commands
```bash
# Start the app (currently shows runtime errors)
npm start

# Type checking (will show type issues to fix later)
npm run typecheck
```

## Notes
- All import paths now use proper FSD structure
- Path aliases (@features, @shared, etc.) are working correctly
- The app architecture follows Feature-Sliced Design principles
- Runtime errors are separate from import resolution and need different fixes
