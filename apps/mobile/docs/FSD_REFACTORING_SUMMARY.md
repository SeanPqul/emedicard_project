# FSD Architecture Refactoring Summary

## Date: 2025-09-29

This document summarizes the COMPLETE refactoring performed to align the codebase with Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) best practices. This includes a thorough double-check and additional refactoring found during the review.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Remove UI components from entities layer
2. Move API hooks from entities to features  
3. Resolve duplicate type definitions
4. Ensure proper layer separation following FSD principles

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Moved UI Components from Entities to Features**

**Components Moved:**
- `entities/application/ui/StepIndicator/` → `features/application/components/StepIndicator/`
- `entities/application/ui/DocumentSourceModal/` → `features/application/components/DocumentSourceModal/`

**Files Updated:**
- `src/features/application/components/index.ts` - Updated to export from local directory
- `src/entities/application/index.ts` - Removed UI component exports
- `src/screens/application/ApplyScreen/ApplyScreen.tsx` - Updated imports

**Reason:** According to FSD, entities should only contain domain models and business entity types, not UI components.

### 2. **Relocated API Hooks from Entities to Features**

**Hooks Moved:**
- `entities/jobCategory/api/useJobCategories.ts` → `features/jobCategory/hooks/useJobCategories.ts`
  - Created new feature folder: `features/jobCategory/`
- `entities/user/api/useUsers.ts` → `features/profile/hooks/useUsers.ts`
  - Added to existing profile feature

**Files Updated:**
- All files importing these hooks (10+ files updated)
- Removed `api/` folders from entities
- Created proper exports in features

**Reason:** Entities should not contain hooks or business logic; these belong in the features layer.

### 3. **Resolved Duplicate Type Definitions**

**Notification Types:**
- Kept base types in `entities/notification/model/types.ts`
- Updated `features/notification/model/types.ts` to:
  - Import base types from entities
  - Add feature-specific extensions (NotificationDisplay, NotificationCategory)
  - Maintain backward compatibility with re-exports

**Activity Types:**
- Consolidated Activity type in `entities/dashboard/model/types.ts`
- Updated `entities/activity/model/types.ts` to re-export from dashboard
- Removed duplicate definitions

**Reason:** Avoid duplicate type definitions and maintain single source of truth.

### 4. **Additional Deep Refactoring (Double-Check Phase)**

**Service Class Moved:**
- `entities/application/model/service.ts` → `features/application/services/applicationService.ts`
  - This service contained business logic that violated FSD (entities shouldn't have business logic)
  - Fixed all imports to not reference features from entities

**Fixed Type Issues:**
- Removed duplicate `JobCategory` definition from `entities/application/model/types.ts`
- JobCategory now only defined in `entities/jobCategory/model/types.ts`
- Fixed `SelectedDocuments` import in validation.ts to use `@shared/types`

**Activity Lib Fixed:**
- Updated `entities/activity/lib/index.ts` to use correct ActivityType values
- Changed from old values ('application', 'payment') to new values ('application_submitted', 'payment_made', etc.)

**Cleaned Stale Directories:**
- Properly removed all `api/` folders from entities that weren't deleted in first pass
- Ensured no UI components (.tsx files) remain in entities layer

## 📁 New Structure

```
src/
├── entities/           # Domain models only
│   ├── activity/       # Re-exports from dashboard
│   ├── application/    # No UI components
│   ├── dashboard/      # Primary Activity type location
│   ├── jobCategory/    # No API hooks
│   ├── notification/   # Base notification types
│   └── user/           # No API hooks
│
├── features/           # Business logic + UI
│   ├── application/
│   │   └── components/ # Contains StepIndicator, DocumentSourceModal
│   ├── jobCategory/    # NEW - Contains hooks
│   │   └── hooks/      # useJobCategories
│   ├── notification/
│   │   └── model/      # Extends entity types
│   └── profile/
│       └── hooks/      # useUsers
```

## 🔄 Import Path Changes

### Before:
```typescript
import { useJobCategories } from '@entities/jobCategory';
import { useUsers } from '@entities/user';
import { StepIndicator } from '@entities/application';
```

### After:
```typescript
import { useJobCategories } from '@features/jobCategory';
import { useUsers } from '@features/profile';
import { StepIndicator } from '@features/application';
```

## 📋 FSD Principles Applied

1. **Layer Separation**: Entities now only contain domain models
2. **One-Way Dependencies**: Features import from entities, not vice versa
3. **Public API**: All exports through index.ts files
4. **Business Logic Placement**: Hooks and services in features layer
5. **UI Component Placement**: All UI components in features or shared layers

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

None - All changes maintain backward compatibility through re-exports and proper aliasing.

## 🔮 Future Considerations

1. **Stub Features**: Consider removing or completing:
   - `features/orientation/` - Only has types, no implementation
   - `features/activity/` - Only has constants

2. **Type Organization**: Consider creating a shared types package for cross-feature types

3. **Further Consolidation**: Some features might benefit from merging (e.g., activity into dashboard)

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. Run full TypeScript type check: `npm run typecheck`
2. Test all screens that use moved components
3. Verify API hooks still function correctly
4. Check that all imports resolve properly
