# Refactored Project Structure

## Overview
This document outlines the updates and refactoring completed on the eMediCard project as of version 2.0.0.

## Key Refactoring Tasks

### Code Modularity
- **Objective**: Enhance modularity and readability by breaking down large files into smaller, purpose-specific modules.
- **Outcome**: Achieved improved code maintainability and testability.

### Dashboard Enhancements
- **Components Created**:
  - `CTAButton`: For primary health card actions.
  - `DashboardHeader`: Consolidated UI component for the dashboard.
- **Components Updated**:
  - Refactoring existing components to utilize shared state and improved interfaces.

### File Structure Revamp
- **`src/components/`**:
  - All UI-related components, such as buttons, loaders, and inputs, have been reorganized.

- **`src/hooks/`**:
  - Custom React hooks like `useDocumentUpload`, `usePayment`, and `useApplicationForm` have been enhanced.

- **`src/utils/`**:
  - Utility files for application logic and validation.

- **`convex/`**:
  - Backend logic refactor with clearly defined modules for various functionalities (e.g., forms, notifications, payments).
  - Maintained backwards compatibility via root-level re-export files.

### Benefits
1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller modules increase readability and reduce complexity.
2. **Reusability**: Code is now easier to reuse across different components and modules.
3. **Scalability**: The codebase is easier to scale with the new modular approach.
4. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Ensures compliance with WCAG standards for a better user experience.

## Migration Guidelines
- Any existing standalone files were moved into appropriate directories with index files consolidating exports.
- Comprehensive `index.ts` files were created to cleanly export all necessary functions and modules.

## Future Directions
- Continued focus on improving modularity and reducing file size through further refactoring efforts.
- Expansion of unit tests to cover new and existing modules for enhanced reliability.
