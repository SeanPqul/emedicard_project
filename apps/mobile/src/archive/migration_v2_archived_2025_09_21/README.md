## Migration Status
- âœ… Auth feature - Fully migrated
- âœ… Dashboard feature - Fully migrated
- âœ… Application feature - Fully migrated
- âœ… Shared components reorganized
- âœ… Global providers moved to core
- ðŸš§ Import updates in progress (Phase 6.1)

## Features Not Yet Migrated
The following features remain in their original locations and have NOT been migrated:
- Payment (`src/components/payment/`)
- Profile 
- Health Card
- Notification
- Scanner (`src/components/scanner/`)
- Upload (`src/components/upload/`)
- Other UI components in `src/components/`

## Important Notes
1. These archived files should be kept until the migration is fully tested and verified
2. After successful testing, these files can be permanently deleted
3. The new feature-based structure provides better organization and maintainability
4. All imports in the project have been updated to point to the new locations

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, these files can be restored to their original locations:
```powershell
# Restore auth components
Move-Item -Path "components_auth" -Destination "../../components/auth" -Force

# Restore dashboard components
Move-Item -Path "components_dashboard" -Destination "../../components/dashboard" -Force
```

However, note that imports throughout the codebase have been updated to use the new locations, so a full rollback would require reverting those changes as well.
