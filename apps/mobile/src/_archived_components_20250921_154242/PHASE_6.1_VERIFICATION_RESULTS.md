# Phase 6.1 Component Archiving Verification Results
Date: September 21, 2025

## Executive Summary
After thorough investigation, most components initially marked as "safe to archive" are actually still being used. Only specific components within directories can be archived.

## Verification Results

### ❌ navigation/ - NOT SAFE TO ARCHIVE (Partially Used)
- **NavigationWrapper** - NOT USED (safe to archive)
- **RoleBasedTabLayout** - STILL USED by `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- **StepNavigation** - NOT USED (safe to archive)

### ❌ profile/ - NOT SAFE TO ARCHIVE  
- **ProfileLink** - STILL USED by `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`

### ❌ scanner/ - NOT SAFE TO ARCHIVE
- **QRCodeScanner** - STILL USED by `app/(screens)/(shared)/qr-scanner.tsx`

### ❌ upload/ - NOT SAFE TO ARCHIVE
- **DragDropUpload** - STILL USED by `app/(screens)/(shared)/upload-documents.tsx`

### ✅ payment/ - SAFE TO ARCHIVE
- **EnhancedPaymentScreen** - NOT USED
- **ImprovedPaymentScreen** - NOT USED  
- **PaymentSubmissionScreen** - NOT USED
- **PaymentMethodCard** - NOT USED
- No imports found in the entire codebase
- No features/payment directory exists (payment logic might be elsewhere)

## Safe to Archive Components

### Individual Files (not entire directories):
1. `src/components/navigation/NavigationWrapper.tsx`
2. `src/components/navigation/StepNavigation.tsx`
3. `src/components/payment/` (entire directory)

## Components Requiring Migration Before Archiving:

### Feature-Specific Components (still used):
1. **RoleBasedTabLayout** → Consider moving to `src/core/navigation/` or `src/shared/navigation/`
2. **ProfileLink** → Should move to `src/features/profile/components/`
3. **QRCodeScanner** → Should move to a feature that handles QR scanning
4. **DragDropUpload** → Should move to feature that handles document uploads

## Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action**: Archive only the payment directory
2. **Phase 6.2**: Migrate the remaining used components to their proper feature locations
3. **Do NOT archive** directories with components still in use

## Command to Archive Payment Directory:
```powershell
Move-Item -Path "src/components/payment" -Destination "src/archive/migration_v2_archived_2025_09_21/" -Force
```
