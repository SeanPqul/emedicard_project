- ‚úÖ `src/components/ui/` now only contains index.ts (re-exports)

## üöß Components Remaining (Feature-Specific - Not Yet Migrated)

These components remain in `src/components/` because they are feature-specific and will be migrated when their respective features are migrated:

### Feature Components:
1. **activity/** - Activity tracking components
   - ActivityItem.tsx
   
2. **feedback/** - Feedback system components
   - FeedbackSystem.tsx
   - Toast.tsx
   
3. **navigation/** - Navigation wrapper components
   - NavigationWrapper.tsx
   - RoleBasedTabLayout.tsx
   - StepNavigation.tsx
   
4. **payment/** - Payment-related components
   - EnhancedPaymentScreen.tsx
   - ImprovedPaymentScreen.tsx
   - PaymentMethodCard.tsx
   - PaymentSubmissionScreen.tsx
   
5. **profile/** - Profile components
   - ProfileLink.tsx
   
6. **scanner/** - QR scanner components
   - QRCodeScanner.tsx
   
7. **stats/** - Statistics components
   - StatCard.tsx
   
8. **upload/** - Upload components
   - DragDropUpload.tsx

### Other Files:
- **__tests__/** - Contains outdated tests for migrated components (needs cleanup)
- **index.tsx** - Main barrel export file
- **MIGRATION_PLAN_REMAINING_COMPONENTS.md** - Migration plan documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Address

### 1. Outdated Test Files
The `__tests__` folder contains tests for components that have been migrated:
- CustomTextInput.test.tsx (component is in shared/components/inputs)
- EmptyState.test.tsx (component is in shared/components/feedback)
- LoadingSpinner.test.tsx (component is in shared/components/feedback)

**Action Required:** These tests should be:
1. Moved to their respective new locations
2. Updated to import from correct paths
3. Or removed if no longer needed

### 2. Empty Directories
- `src/components/common/` - Only contains index.ts
- `src/components/ui/` - Only contains index.ts

**Recommendation:** Keep these for now as they provide backward compatibility through re-exports

## üìä Migration Summary

### Total Components Status:
- **Migrated/Removed:** 13 component directories
- **Remaining:** 8 feature-specific component directories
- **Test files needing attention:** 3

### Is it Safe to Archive?

**NO** - Do not archive the entire `src/components/` directory yet because:

1. ‚úÖ **Safe to archive:**
   - The outdated test files in `__tests__/`
   - Migration documentation files

2. ‚ùå **Must keep:**
   - All feature-specific components (activity, feedback, navigation, payment, profile, scanner, stats, upload)
   - The index files for backward compatibility
   
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs cleanup:**
   - The `__tests__/` folder should be addressed first

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Move or remove the outdated test files** in `__tests__/`
2. **Keep all feature-specific components** in place for future migration phases
3. **Do not archive** the src/components directory - it still contains valid, unmigrated components
4. **Document** which features own which components for future migration phases
