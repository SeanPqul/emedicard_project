# Feature-Slice Design Refactoring Plan

## Pre-Migration Setup

1. Create Migration Branch: `git checkout -b migration`
2. Setup Backup: Ensure current work is committed before starting

INVARIANT: Preserve routing entrypoint
- The Expo Router `app/` folder MUST remain at `apps/mobile/app/`.
- Do NOT move or rename `apps/mobile/app/` into `src/`. All feature files will live under `apps/mobile/src/features/...` and route files will import/re-export those screens.
- After each feature extraction, run the route smoke-test (see below) to confirm routes still work.


## Progress Tracking System

The MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md file will contain:
- ‚úÖ Completed tasks (checked)
- üîÑ In-progress tasks
- ‚è≥ Pending tasks
- üìù Notes for each phase
- üêõ Issues encountered
- ‚ö° Performance improvements

## Task Execution Flow

For each task:
1. Update markdown file to mark task as "üîÑ In Progress"
2. Execute the refactoring steps
3. Test functionality (ill do the test for the device)
4. Update markdown file to mark as "‚úÖ Completed"
5. Commit changes with descriptive message
6. Move to next task

When you extract a feature, include the following 3-step micro-task for every route touched:
7. Create or update route file in apps/mobile/app/ to lazy-import feature UI from apps/mobile/src/features/<feature>/ui/.....
8. After extracting, run lint and typecheck to detect issues introduced by the change:
9. Commits & pushes the change with: git commit -m "refactor(<feature>): route proxies import from src/features" and includes branch and commit info in the report. ( depends on what you do)
