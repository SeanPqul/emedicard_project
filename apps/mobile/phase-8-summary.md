# Phase 8: Codemods for Import Paths - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Phase 8 of the FSD migration has been successfully completed. All import paths throughout the codebase have been updated to use the new FSD aliases.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Updated TypeScript Configuration
- Added all FSD slice aliases to `tsconfig.json`:
  - `@screens/*` for screens layer
  - `@entities/*` for domain entities
  - `@processes/*` for cross-feature processes
  - `@types/*` for generic types

### 2. Bulk Import Path Updates
Created and executed `update-imports-to-fsd.ps1` script that:
- Scanned 414 TypeScript files
- Updated 62 files with the following changes:
  - Domain types: `@/src/types/domain/*` → `@entities/*/model/types`
  - Entity services: `@/src/features/*/services/*Service` → `@entities/*/model/service`
  - Entity UI: `@/src/features/*/components/*` → `@entities/*/ui/*`
  - Shared imports: `@/src/shared/*` → `@shared/*`
  - Features: `@/src/features/*` → `@features/*`
  - Screens: `@/src/screens/*` → `@screens/*`
  - Types: `@/src/types/*` → `@types/*`

### 3. Relative Import Conversion
Created and executed `update-relative-imports.ps1` script that:
- Scanned 414 TypeScript files
- Converted 43 files from relative imports to FSD aliases
- Updated paths like `../../shared/` → `@shared/`
- Updated paths like `../features/` → `@features/`
- Ensured no relative imports remain between FSD layers

## Results

- **Total files processed**: 414
- **Files updated with new aliases**: 62
- **Files converted from relative imports**: 43
- **Build status**: ✅ Successful (verified)
- **No legacy import patterns remaining**

## Import Path Examples

### Before:
```typescript
import { Application } from '@/src/types/domain/application';
import { apiClient } from '@/src/shared/api/client';
import { Button } from '../../shared/components/ui/Button';
import { useAuth } from '../services/authService';
```

### After:
```typescript
import { Application } from '@entities/application/model/types';
import { apiClient } from '@shared/api/client';
import { Button } from '@shared/components/ui/Button';
import { useAuth } from '@features/auth/services/authService';
```

## Next Steps

With Phase 8 complete, the codebase now has:
- ✅ Clean, consistent import paths using FSD aliases
- ✅ No relative imports between layers
- ✅ Clear architectural boundaries visible through imports

The only remaining phase is:
- **Phase 9**: Cleanup legacy/archived directories
