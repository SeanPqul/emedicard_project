## 🔧 **Technical Achievements**

### **Service Layer Architecture**
- **ApplicationService:** Static methods for business logic, validation, and state management
- **ApiClient:** Singleton pattern with Convex integration, error handling, and retry logic
- **StorageService:** Unified storage interface with expiration, batch operations, and type safety

### **Component Architecture**
- **Feature Co-location:** Related components grouped by feature
- **Shared Components:** Reusable UI components with consistent theming
- **Type Safety:** Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Barrel Exports:** Clean import structure with index.ts files

### **Code Quality Improvements**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear boundaries between features, shared code, and business logic
- **Maintainability:** Related code co-located, consistent patterns
- **Testability:** Service layer enables unit testing, isolated components
- **Performance:** Singleton services, optimized imports, efficient state management
