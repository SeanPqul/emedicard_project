# Constants FSD Migration Complete ✅

## Summary
All constants have been successfully migrated to their proper FSD locations according to the Feature-Sliced Design principles.

## What Was Done

### 1. Shared Constants → `src/shared/constants/`
- **api.ts** - HTTP status codes, methods, content types
- **app.ts** - Application-wide constants (roles, formats, validation)
- **ui.ts** - UI/UX constants (animations, dimensions, z-index)

### 2. Feature Constants → `src/features/[feature]/constants.ts`
- **activity-filters.ts** → `src/features/activity/constants.ts`
- **application.ts** → `src/features/application/constants.ts`
- **payment-methods.ts** → `src/features/payment/constants.ts`

### 3. Updated Imports
- ✅ `app/(screens)/(shared)/activity.tsx` - Now imports from `@/src/features/activity/constants`
- ✅ `app/(screens)/(shared)/payment.tsx` - Now imports from `@/src/features/payment/constants`
- ✅ `src/features/application/screens/ApplyScreen/ApplyScreen.tsx` - Now imports from `@/src/features/application/constants`

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Kept `src/constants/index.ts` with re-exports for backward compatibility
- Added deprecation notice to encourage direct imports

## Current Structure

```
src/
├── shared/
│   └── constants/
│       ├── api.ts        # API-related constants
│       ├── app.ts        # App-wide constants
│       ├── ui.ts         # UI/UX constants
│       └── index.ts      # Barrel export
├── features/
│   ├── activity/
│   │   └── constants.ts  # Activity feature constants
│   ├── application/
│   │   └── constants.ts  # Application feature constants
│   └── payment/
│       └── constants.ts  # Payment feature constants
└── constants/
    └── index.ts          # Backward compatibility (deprecated)
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature owns its constants
2. **Clear Dependencies**: Easy to see what constants each feature uses
3. **Better Maintenance**: Constants are co-located with the code that uses them
4. **FSD Compliance**: Follows proper layering principles

## Migration Impact

- **No Breaking Changes**: Backward compatibility maintained
- **Clean Architecture**: Constants follow FSD principles
- **Better Organization**: Clear separation between shared and feature-specific constants
- **Improved Discoverability**: Constants are where you expect them to be

## Next Steps

1. **Remove Backward Compatibility**: Once all team members update their imports, remove `src/constants/index.ts`
2. **Archive Old Folder**: After removing backward compatibility, archive the `src/constants` folder
3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all docs reference the new constant locations

The constants migration is complete and follows proper FSD architecture!
