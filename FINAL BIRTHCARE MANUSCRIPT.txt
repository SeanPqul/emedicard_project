INTRODUCTION


Project Context

      In the continuous development of healthcare services, ensuring efficient and accessible maternal care remains a crucial priority. Despite advancements in medical technology and healthcare systems, birthing homes still face challenges in managing patient records, tracking labor and delivery, and ensuring proper postnatal care. Many birthing facilities rely on traditional paper-based documentation, which is prone to inefficiencies such as misplaced records, delayed access to patient information, and difficulty in monitoring patient history. These challenges affect healthcare providers, increasing their workload and potentially compromising the quality of care given to mothers and newborns.
      The need for an improved birthing home management system is evident, particularly in local communities where healthcare accessibility is limited. Midwives and healthcare professionals often handle multiple responsibilities, including patient admissions, labor monitoring, delivery assistance, and postnatal checkups. The absence of a digitalized system makes these tasks more time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to inconsistencies in documentation and difficulties in retrieving patient data when needed. A web-based birthing home management system offers a solution by integrating essential patient care processes into a centralized platform, streamlining operations, and ensuring accurate record-keeping.
      From firsthand experience and observations, the reliance on manual systems in birthing homes presents significant operational challenges. Paper-based records are often misplaced, disorganized, or lost, which results in delays in accessing critical patient information. During emergencies, such inefficiencies can lead to poor decision-making and suboptimal maternal and newborn care. Furthermore, postnatal care tracking remains a challenge due to the lack of a structured follow-up system, making it difficult for healthcare providers to monitor the well- being of mothers and their babies after childbirth. Implementing a web-based system will address these issues by providing real-time access to patient records, improving communication

among healthcare staff, and ensuring seamless monitoring of maternal and newborn health.

      The implementation of a web-based birthing home management system aligns with the goal of leveraging technology to improve healthcare services. By integrating features such as digital record-keeping, automated admission tracking, labor and delivery monitoring, and structured postnatal care documentation, the system enhances efficiency and allows healthcare providers to focus more on patient care rather than administrative tasks. This transition from manual to digital management will not only streamline operations but also contribute to better healthcare outcomes for mothers and newborns.

      Additionally, a digital system ensures data security and accuracy, reducing the risk of misplaced or lost records. It also facilitates easier data retrieval, enabling midwives and healthcare staff to access patient history instantly, which is crucial for informed decision- making. By addressing the inefficiencies of traditional record-keeping, the proposed system enhances the overall quality of maternal care and provides a structured approach to managing birthing home operations.

      This research aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to modernize healthcare services, particularly in maternal and newborn care. By examining the impact of a web-based birthing home management system on healthcare accessibility, patient satisfaction, and service quality, this study highlights the potential of digital solutions in addressing prevailing issues in birthing home management. The findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for healthcare institutions, policymakers, and technology developers, promoting the adoption of innovative solutions to improve maternal and newborn healthcare services.

      In essence, this project seeks to bridge the gap between traditional healthcare practices and modern technological advancements. By providing an efficient and reliable platform for managing patient records and healthcare processes, the proposed system ensures that birthing homes can deliver high-quality care to mothers and newborns while minimizing administrative burdens on healthcare providers.

Purpose and Description

      The purpose of this project is to develop a structured, accessible, and efficient system to improve the management of birthing homes. By implementing this web-based platform, the system aims to ensure organized patient records, seamless admission processing, accurate tracking of patients on labor and delivery, structured postnatal care, and an internal patient billing module. It is designed to support midwives, facility owners, and other staff in handling patient information efficiently, ensuring better coordination of maternal and newborn healthcare services. By replacing manual record-keeping with a digital system, this project minimizes errors, reduces administrative workload, and enhances the overall efficiency of birthing home operations.

      This Web-Based Birthing Home Patient Services and Records Management System consists of key functional modules tailored for different users. The Facility Owner Module can manage staff accounts, oversee patient records, handle subscription-based access, and monitor overall operations. The Encoder Module can handle patient registration, admission, certificate of live birth generation, and manage patient document collection. The Midwife Module enables midwives to manage patient prenatal care, labor & delivery, postpartum care, emergency referrals, patient discharge, and postnatal follow-up care. The Nurse Module can manage patient monitoring and newborn care. The Doctor's Module can manage newborn screening, pediatric referrals, doctor's prescriptions, and family planning consultations. The Billing Clerk Module is responsible for patient billing, including processing charges for services rendered, tracking payments, and generating patient billing records. The Operation Manager Module can oversee the daily operations, manage the prenatal and post- natal schedules, and generate reports.

      The system does not handle any PhilHealth reimbursement operations, including the submission of claims or receiving payments from PhilHealth through online. The system does not allow tracking of PhilHealth-related claims, updates will be processed manually by the staff based on external communication (e.g., phone calls). The system only accepts patient PhilHealth-related basic information such as philhealth number and category with its information submitted by the patient so that the patient can still use her PhilHealth. All claim processing and reimbursement transactions are handled manually by the birthing home outside of the system. Additionally, The system also features a Mapping Module that provides an interactive map displaying nearby birthing homes using the same system. This module assists users in identifying patients with existing medical records from other facilities, allowing midwives to review prenatal and consultation histories for accurate referrals and improved continuity of maternal care. Furthermore, the system includes a subscription-based user management feature, allowing facility owner's to subscribe, renew, and manage accounts for the birthing home users seamlessly.

      By integrating patient care management, structured billing records, and subscription- based access into a single platform, the system reduces administrative workload while enhancing service delivery. The platform provides a centralized approach to managing patient care, allowing birthing homes to operate more smoothly and effectively. Secure documentation ensures that medical data remains updated and accessible whenever needed. This innovation modernizes birthing home management by making maternal healthcare more accessible, organized, and efficient.

      This project is particularly beneficial for local birthing homes that require a structured and reliable way to manage patient records and internal billing documentation. By transitioning from paper-based processes to a digital system, it enhances service quality, minimizes errors, and improves maternal and newborn care. The system allows midwives and facility owners to collaborate effectively, ensuring that every patient receives the necessary care without unnecessary administrative burdens. Automated workflows improve efficiency, reduce delays, and enhance overall maternal healthcare services.

Scope and Limitations

      The Web-Based Birthing Home Patient Services and Records Management System is designed to support maternal and newborn care by providing a centralized digital platform for managing patient records, admissions, labor and delivery monitoring, and postnatal care. It also supports administrative operations such as billing, document generation, mapping, and subscription handling. The system aims to reduce manual workload, ensure data accuracy, and improve access to important patient information. While it streamlines processes for staff and the facility owner, it does not replace the clinical responsibilities of healthcare providers or include full-scale financial or laboratory management.

Scope
The system will include the following modules and features:

Patient Records Management
      This module allows midwives and the facility owner to manage patient records from admission to postnatal care. It stores essential patient details such as medical history, vital signs, labor progress, and delivery outcomes. With centralized data storage and real-time updates, it ensures records are accurate, complete, and easy to access.

Billing and Payment Management
      This module facilitates accurate computation and record-keeping of patient expenses, particularly based on predefined maternity care packages or services offered. While it does not track itemized charges like laboratory tests or professional fees, it enables staff to input total charges, generate receipts, and monitor payment status linked to each patient.

      This module allows the facility owners to manage system access based on subscription plans (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, 5 years). It includes tools for renewing, and tracking subscriptions, with automated reminders for upcoming expirations. It also allows for basic plan customization and monitoring of account status. This module integrates with PayMongo, an online payment gateway that enables secure and convenient subscription payments through GCash, debit card, or credit card. This feature enhances accessibility and efficiency by automating the subscription process and reducing manual payment handling.

Limitations

Technical Limitations:
      The system relies on stable internet connectivity to ensure real-time access and updates. Without a reliable internet connection, the system may experience delays in updating patient data and generating reports. Furthermore, the system is designed exclusively as a web application and is not optimized for mobile devices, meaning it is not mobile-responsive. The system does not integrate with external hardware such as barcode scanners or biometric devices, which limits its functionality, particularly in areas that require physical identification or real-time tracking. Moreover, the system does not manage or control printing hardware directly, meaning an external printer setup is required for printing receipts and documents. The PayMongo integration is limited exclusively to the Subscription Management module. It handles subscription payments for birthing homes through online transactions. Other payment processes, such as those managed under the Billing and Payment Management module, continue to rely on cash-on-hand payments and are not connected to PayMongo.
Operational Limitations:
      The Birthing Home Management System is designed for use exclusively within Davao City and is tailored to the workflows and operational requirements of local birthing homes. It is not intended for deployment or use in other regions without significant customization. Healthcare staff must manually input all vital signs and medical data, as the system does not support real-time integration with medical devices. This manual data entry process may increase the risk of human error. Patient-submitted documents, such as PhilHealth forms, must also be manually uploaded by staff, which can lead to inaccuracies or delays in documentation. The system does not include automated patient reminder features for postnatal follow- ups, requiring staff to manage scheduling and follow-ups manually. Payment confirmations, subscription status updates, and PhilHealth claim tracking are also processed manually, which may result in delays or errors. Furthermore, the system does not facilitate electronic PhilHealth reimbursements; all claims must be prepared and submitted manually by the birthing home staff.

Functional Limitations:
      The system does not support automated error detection in patient records, billing entries, or document uploads. This means that if incorrect data is entered, the system will not automatically flag or correct the mistakes. Report generation relies on accurate manual input, and the system does not auto-correct inconsistent entries, which can lead to discrepancies in generated reports if incorrect data is entered. Subscription plan upgrades, renewals, and cancellations require manual confirmation if there are payment issues, and there is no automated error handling for payment-related problems. Only authorized personnel can edit or modify patient records and financial data, ensuring security but requiring manual oversight to prevent unauthorized changes. Additionally, the system does not support inventory management for vitamins, medications, and other prescribed items. These supplies must be tracked manually by the staff, as the system does not track stock levels or manage inventory.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE/STUDIES/SYSTEMS

Related Studies and/or Systems

Antenatal Care Management Platform (Aliyi, A., Mesfin, B., Hassen, F. et al. 2023)

      Pregnancy is a process of developing a fetus in a woman's womb leading to anatomical and physiological changes. Currently, numerous health facilities offering antenatal services are yet to adopt health informatics. This led to several challenges, including unskilled, early and poor quality antenatal and delivery care, case traffic because many patients are admitted per day, and shy medical professional doctors, nurses, midwives and nursing aids. The main idea of this project was to design and develop a new system for managing maternal health in antenatal care. (Alivi., A., Mesfin, B., Hassen, F. et al. 2023)
      This web-based antenatal care management platform is designed using XAMPP, PHP, HTML and CSS. It involves designing the stoner interface and identifying the inputs, outputs, and processes of the designed system. The configuration involves the use of case diagrams, sequence diagrams and class diagram tools to achieve the physical consummation of the antenatal care management platform and positive living information system. The purpose of this work was to create a web-based platform for managing antenatal care.


Effect of Midwives' Application of Intelligent Delivery Room Management System on Delivery Outcome

     Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of implementing an intelligent Delivery Room Management System (IDRMS) by midwives on delivery outcomes. The study included 100 primaries who were admitted between January 2019 and June 2020. They were randomized to either the observation group, which had midwives using the IDRMS, included data from portable monitoring equipment, analgesia pump operations, and real-time monitoring of maternal physiological indicators, all of which were available to medical personnel via mobile devices. In an effort to improve job productivity and the

quality of birthing, the technology also made electronic documentation and interaction with hospital information systems easier.

      The results showed that, in comparison to the control group, the observation group's first and second stages of labor were noticeably shorter. The observation group also reported higher neonatal Apgar scores and decreased postpartum Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores. Interestingly, the observation group experienced a decreased rate of vaginal deliveries turning into cesarean sections. Additionally, the observation group's postpartum anxiety and despair levels were much lower, suggesting that mother's psychological health had improved. These findings imply that midwives' use of IDRMS can improve mother and newborn health by having a positive impact on delivery outcomes.

Designing a Midwife-Led Birth Center Program Based on the MAP-IT Model: A Sequential Explanatory Mixed-Methods Study (Bakhshi, M., Mollazadeh, S., Khadivzadeh, T., Moghri, J., Saki, A., & Firoozi, M. (2024).)


      A 2024 study utilized the MAP-IT model to design a midwife-led birth center program. This sequential explanatory mixed-methods study emphasized the importance of understanding community attitudes and preferences toward midwifery care. The findings highlighted that tailored midwife-led care models could effectively address the needs of low-risk pregnancies, promoting positive birth experiences and outcomes. In recent decades, childbirth has increasingly been treated as a medical event, often sidelining the traditional role of midwives. This shift has led to a reliance on medical interventions, such as cesarean sections, which may not always be necessary. Recognizing this trend, a study titled "Designing a Midwife-Led Birth Center Program Based on the MAP-IT Model: A Sequential Explanatory Mixed-Methods Study" aimed to develop a program that emphasizes midwifery-led care, offering a more natural and personalized childbirth experience.

      This study stands out as the first to utilize a mixed-method approach based on the MAP- IT model to design a midwife-led maternity care program. By aligning the program with the specific needs and preferences of pregnant women and midwives, it aims to empower midwives and promote a more natural childbirth process. The anticipated outcome is an improvement in maternal and infant health outcomes, offering women a supportive environment that respects their childbirth choices.


Synthesis


      The review of related studies and systems underscores the evolving landscape of maternal healthcare delivery, characterized by innovative solutions aimed at enhancing accessibility, efficiency, and quality of care for mothers and newborns.
      The Antenatal Care Management Platform (Aliyi et al., 2023) represents a significant advancement in maternal health technology, emphasizing structured digital health solutions to address challenges such as poor-quality antenatal care and high patient volume. By implementing a web-based platform, this system streamlines patient records, improves monitoring, and enhances service delivery in antenatal care.
      The Intelligent Delivery Room Management System (IDRMS), introduced by Li et al. (2022), highlights the transformative potential of digital innovations in labor and delivery management. By integrating real-time monitoring, electronic documentation, and automated medical processes, the IDRMS optimizes workflow efficiency and improves maternal and neonatal outcomes, reducing labor duration and enhancing patient safety.

      Additionally, the Midwife-Led Birth Center Program by Bakhshi et al. (2024) underscores the importance of personalized, midwifery-centered care in modern maternal health services. By utilizing the MAP-IT model, this program shifts  away from medicalized childbirth and prioritizes holistic, patient-centered care, empowering midwives and enhancing natural birthing experiences.
      In contrast, the developers' proposed An Web-Based Birthing Home Management System aims to redefine maternal healthcare delivery by integrating digital record-keeping, labor and delivery monitoring, and postnatal care management. Unlike existing systems, this platform focuses on a comprehensive approach to birthing home operations, ensuring structured patient records, seamless admission, billing and payment processes, and efficient birth certificate generation. While previous systems have significantly improved healthcare accessibility and efficiency, this Birthing Home Management System stands out for its tailored design, aligning with the specific needs of midwives and maternal care providers. By seamlessly integrating technology into birthing home management, this system promises to enhance maternal healthcare services, ensuring better coordination, improved outcomes, and streamlined workflows in the digital age.

METHODOLOGY


Technical Background

Overview of Current Technologies to be Used in the System

      Technologies that help healthcare institutions improve their operations are among humanity's greatest innovations. A web-based management system is one of these breakthroughs. These systems are accessible to all users due to their scalability, efficiency, and automation capabilities. They have become essential in medical facilities as they enhance record-keeping accuracy and streamline patient management.
      The Web-based Birthing Home Management System is designed to facilitate patient records management, admissions, labor and delivery tracking, and postnatal care. Unlike traditional manual systems, this web-based platform allows midwives and facility owners to easily access and update patient information from any desktop device with a web browser and an internet connection. This ensures a dynamic and efficient workflow, reducing paperwork and improving overall service delivery.
      To guide the development process, the proponents will follow the Spiral Model (Please refer to Figure 2, Page 75). This iterative methodology allows the system to be developed in cycles, with each round consisting of four phases: planning, risk analysis, product development, and evaluation. This model is ideal for the project as it supports continuous user feedback and refinement-an important approach for a system involving sensitive healthcare data and operational complexity. By revisiting each phase multiple times, the team can manage potential risks early and ensure the system's quality, reliability, and alignment with real-world birthing home needs.
      The developers will also make use of Use Case Diagrams to map out how each system user-such as encoder, midwives, doctors, nurse, facility owners, and billing clerks-interacts with the system. These diagrams help identify system functionalities like patient registration, labor monitoring, birth certificate generation, and billing access. They provide a visual guide for

planning and testing each user feature, ensuring that system roles and permissions are clearly defined and implemented according to real workflows.
      In addition to Use Case Diagrams, a Domain Class Diagram will be used to design the structure of the system's database. The Domain Diagram will outline the relationships between entities such as patients, admissions, labor records, billing entries, and users. This will ensure data consistency and integrity throughout the platform, especially when managing interconnected records like patient details linked to delivery logs or billing information. By designing a well-structured database early on, the developers can reduce redundancy and prevent future data-related issues.
      For the visual and technical side of the system, the proponents are going to use Figma as a design tool to create mockups and prototypes of the user interface. This will help visualize and refine page layouts, navigation structure, and user experience based on feedback during the early stages. The frontend will be built using Next.js, ensuring an interactive, responsive, and modern web interface. Styling will be handled with Tailwind CSS, which allows for efficient and consistent design elements across all pages.
      On the backend, Laravel will be used-a powerful PHP framework known for its security and scalability. Laravel's features like built-in authentication and Eloquent ORM will help manage patient records and ensure secure data handling. The database behind the system will be MySQL, chosen for its reliability and performance in handling structured medical data.
      To improve communication and alerts within the platform, Node.js will be integrated to handle real-time notifications. This feature will allow the system to notify midwives about new admissions, active labor cases, or required postnatal follow-ups-enhancing responsiveness and patient care.
      Moreover, the system will include a billing and payments module that helps facility owners to generate invoices, track services rendered, and log transactions. Although the initial version focuses on onsite payments, the system will be designed to accommodate digital payment integration in the future, allowing for system scalability as the birthing home's operations grow.

      By combining tools like Use Case Diagrams, Domain Diagram, and the Spiral Model with modern technologies such as Next.js, Laravel, Node.js, and MySQL, the proponents aim to deliver a well-planned, efficient, and secure Web-Based Birthing Home Management System. This project is designed not only to streamline workflows and enhance data accuracy but also to support safer, faster, and more organized maternal healthcare services.

Requirements Gathering and Analysis

      The development of the Web-Based Birthing Home Management System began with a crucial step: understanding the actual needs and workflow of the birthing home. The team recognized that for the system to be truly helpful, it had to reflect the real-life processes and responsibilities of the staff who would use it daily. To achieve this, they started with background research on existing maternal care systems and examined how technology was currently being used in similar healthcare settings. This provided valuable insights into common gaps and limitations, helping the team set a clear direction for what the system should address.
      The heart of the requirement's gathering process was a four-day interview session with the birthing home's key personnel. These included midwives, nurses, a billing clerk, and an encoder. Each day of the session was dedicated to understanding a specific aspect of the birthing home's operations. On the first day, the team focused on patient intake and record management. Staff members walked the team through how patient information is collected during admission, how records are updated, and how data is handled during a patient's stay. They emphasized the need for a system that could store and

update patient data efficiently from admission to discharge.

      The second day was centered on labor and delivery processes. The midwives and nurses explained how they monitor patients during childbirth and how important it is to record each detail as the labor progresses. They noted the challenges of keeping manual records up to date in such a fast-paced setting and expressed interest in having an organized digital log that would allow them to record and view patient updates in real time.
      On the third day, the conversation shifted to postnatal care. The team asked about discharge procedures and how care instructions were communicated to new mothers. The staff stressed the importance of clear documentation of postnatal instructions and prescriptions. They wanted these to be part of the system so they wouldn't have to rely on scattered handwritten notes or verbal reminders, which can easily be forgotten or lost.
      The fourth and final day focused on administrative concerns. The billing clerk and encoder discussed how billing is currently handled, including how payments are recorded and how they manage package availment manually. They shared their struggles with tracking payment records using separate logs and stressed the need for a simple module that could accurately record payments and monitor the status of packages availed by patients. They also noted that generating summary reports such as birth counts and postnatal statistics would be helpful for both internal tracking and reporting to local health units.
      Throughout the interviews, several consistent themes emerged. The staff agreed that a centralized system was essential to handle all aspects of patient care, from admission to postnatal discharge. They highlighted the need for manual entry options for referral cases and PhilHealth claim details, noting that although automation in these areas wasn't necessary, it was important to organize the information digitally. Generating a Certificate of Live Birth was also mentioned as a core feature, as it is a critical document in every childbirth case.
Another point emphasized during the discussions was the importance of

role-based access. The team learned that different staff members should have access to different parts of the system. For example, midwives and nurses should manage medical data, while the billing clerk and encoder should focus on financial records and reports. This would protect sensitive information and ensure that each user could work more efficiently within their assigned role.
      By the end of the four-day session, the team had a clear and complete understanding of what the system needed to include. From patient registration and labor tracking to discharge documentation and billing, each feature was grounded in the real-world needs of the birthing home staff. This in-depth and collaborative approach ensured that the system would not only be functional but also practical, making daily tasks easier for healthcare workers and improving maternal care services in Davao City.

Design of Software, System, Product, and/or Processes

      The design phase of BirthCare was a carefully orchestrated process that utilized a variety of tools and methodologies to create a solid, scalable, and user-focused system. The goal was to deliver a platform capable of supporting the operational needs of healthcare professionals in a birthing home while remaining flexible enough to accommodate future enhancements and changing requirements.

This comprehensive approach ensured that the system would not only be effective in managing patient records, delivery processes, billing, and postnatal care, but also adaptable as the platform grows.
      At the core of the system's design was Figma, a collaborative interface design tool used to prototype and visualize the user interface (UI) of BirthCare. Figma proved to be an essential tool for developing an accurate and interactive representation of the system's UI. The ability to create clickable prototypes allowed the development team, as well as key stakeholders like healthcare professionals, to interact with the design early in the process. This ensured that the user interface was intuitive, functional, and met the needs of the users. Figma's real-time collaboration feature enabled designers, developers, and stakeholders to work together on the same prototype simultaneously, providing immediate feedback and allowing for quick revisions. This streamlined the iterative design process, resulting in a UI that was both visually appealing and user-friendly. (Please refer to Figure 44-75, Page 116-131)
      In addition to Figma, the development team created a series of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams to formally define and visualize the system's architecture and behavior. DataBase Design was created to map out the relationships between key data entities in the system. The DataBase Design helped visualize how patient records, midwives, nurses, billing information, and delivery details interacted within the system. This diagram was essential for designing a robust database structure that could handle complex data interactions while maintaining data integrity and avoiding redundancy. By ensuring that these relationships were clearly defined, the team could design a database capable of efficiently handling large volumes of data, with the flexibility to scale as the platform grows.
      The database design focused on normalization, data integrity, and performance. Each table was structured to minimize redundancy through normalization techniques, ensuring that data such as patient information, user roles, billing entries, and medical histories were stored logically and efficiently. Referential integrity was enforced using primary and foreign key relationships, which safeguarded the consistency and accuracy of data throughout the system.
The team also considered indexing and query optimization in preparation for

real-world use, allowing the system to retrieve data quickly even as records increased. This well-planned database architecture enabled smooth integration between modules and laid the groundwork for secure, consistent, and high-performance data management.
      Once the database design was completed, the team focused on defining the system architecture. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern was chosen for its clear separation of concerns, allowing the development team to organize the codebase in a modular and maintainable way. In MVC, the Model component manages the data and business logic of the system, handling tasks like storing patient records, delivery details, and billing information. The View component is responsible for the presentation layer, ensuring that the user interface designed in Figma is faithfully rendered and providing a smooth user experience. The Controller acts as the intermediary between the Model and View, processing user inputs, updating the data in the Model, and refreshing the View as necessary.
      The MVC pattern provided several benefits for the development team. By isolating each component, developers were able to work on separate parts of the system without interfering with one another's work. This modular approach facilitated parallel development and made it easier to update or modify individual components without affecting the rest of the system. Moreover, MVC contributed to better code maintainability and scalability, making it easier to debug and implement updates as the system evolves.
      On the programming side, the team decided to use a procedural programming approach. This paradigm organizes the system's logic into a series of functions or procedures, each designed to perform specific tasks, such as input validation, calculating billing charges, or creating a certificate of live birth. The procedural approach was particularly suited for managing structured workflows and ensuring that tasks like patient record management and payment processing were carried out in a clear and sequential manner. This approach helped simplify the system's logic and made it easier for developers to trace and fix issues. By using a procedural style, the team also made it possible to isolate functionalities, ensuring that updates to one part of the system could be made without affecting others.
In addition, the team utilized the Factory Method Design Pattern to manage

the creation of objects, such as patient records, user roles (e.g., midwife, nurse, encoder), and various types of reports. This pattern enabled the system to dynamically instantiate objects without being tightly coupled to specific class implementations, improving scalability and flexibility for future feature expansion.
      To further enhance modularity and efficiency, the team also applied the Singleton Pattern to manage shared system resources such as database connections and configuration settings ensuring that only one instance of these critical resources exists throughout the system lifecycle. This helped prevent unnecessary resource duplication and streamlined data handling across different modules.
    For scenarios involving complex decision-making, such as determining patient referral pathways or handling varying billing computations based on package avails, the Strategy Pattern was employed. This allowed the system to define a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulate them for use depending on specific conditions, reducing the need for rigid conditional statements and enhancing code reusability.
      Additionally, the Observer Pattern was integrated into parts of the system that benefit from real-time updates and notifications, such as tracking subscription status or sending manual alerts for postnatal care follow-ups. By using this pattern, relevant modules could be automatically updated when changes occurred, supporting a more responsive and maintainable architecture.
     Together, these methodologies and tools Model-View-Controller (MVC) for system architecture, Factory Method for flexible object creation, Singleton for managing shared instances, Strategy for dynamic process selection, Observer for real-time updates, procedural programming for clear and modular logic, and the detailed System Design Class Diagrams-formed the backbone of BirthCare's design. This integrated and design-pattern-driven approach ensured that the system not only met the current operational needs of birthing home professionals, but was also adaptable to future changes. The team's focus on scalability, maintainability, and user-centered design laid a strong foundation for the successful implementation of BirthCare, creating a platform that effectively supports the management of patient care during the birthing process and beyond.

Database Design Discussion Per Objective

To further elaborate on the database structure and its alignment with the project's objectives, the following sections detail the design considerations for each key module:

Objective: To develop a web-based system that allows users to manage birthing home services.

     The database design models facilities, staff, rooms, services, and operating schedules to support centralized management of birthing home operations. Users and their roles (e.g., system administrator, facility owner, staff) are captured to establish authorization and responsibility. Facilities are linked to their owners and include location attributes used throughout the system. Facility staff associates users to specific facilities with clinical or administrative roles, enabling accurate personnel rosters. Rooms define available capacity and room types per facility, while services represent the catalog of billable offerings (e.g., delivery packages, room charges, laboratory services) with default pricing. Facility schedules store opening days and hours for operational visibility. Together, these entities provide a comprehensive foundation for configuring and managing the services, resources, and personnel of each birthing home.

Objective: To develop a patient admission module that enables staff to record, track, and manage patient admissions, including personal details, assigned rooms, and attending personnel.

     This module is structured around patient identity, facility registration, admission events, attending staff, and room assignments. The patient table holds core demographics, while a per-facility profile assigns a unique medical record number for patients who visit multiple birthing homes. Admissions record the start of care, reason, status, and the primary attending provider, forming the anchor for inpatient workflows. Room assignments track which room and bed are occupied over time, preserving transfer history and occupancy data. A junction between admissions and facility staff records all personnel roles involved in the case (e.g., attending, assistant, nurse), enabling precise clinical accountability. This combination supports full lifecycle tracking of inpatient encounters, from intake to discharge, including personal details, room allocation, and attending personnel.

Objective: To develop a billing and payment module that facilitates accurate computation and record-keeping of patient charges and expenses.

     The financial model links services, invoices, invoice items, and payments to produce transparent billing. Services define standard billable items and prices, creating a consistent basis for charges. Invoices represent bills issued to patients, tied to the facility and optionally to an admission, and maintain status and running balances. Each invoice is itemized through invoice items, which store quantities, unit prices, and line totals-supporting detailed cost capture and adjustments. Payments record settlements against invoices, including amounts, methods, timestamps, and references, enabling reconciliation and audit trails. By normalizing services and separating invoice headers from line items and payments, the schema ensures precise calculation of charges and accurate, traceable financial records.

Objective: To develop a patient discharge module that includes documentation of doctor's prescriptions and necessary postnatal instructions.

     Discharge documentation centers on the admission context and the clinical outputs produced at the end of care. The discharge record captures the date and time, clinical outcome, a narrative summary, and explicit postnatal instructions, all attributed to the responsible staff member. Prescriptions are stored separately with a header that identifies the facility, patient, related admission, prescriber, and date, while prescription items enumerate each medication's name, dosage, frequency, duration, and instructions. This separation supports clear clinical documentation and safe medication guidance while preserving attribution and timelines. The result is a complete discharge package that formalizes clinical outcomes and postnatal guidance and records the prescriptive plan for continuity of care.

Objective: To develop a report generation and document management module that includes certificate of live birth creation and storing patient documents, where filled forms can be printed as PDF.

      The database design for this objective focuses on storing structured form data that the system can use to generate printable PDF reports, as well as managing the resulting files. The birth certificates table captures all fields that appear on the certificate of live birth form-such as newborn details, parent information, facility and admission references, certificate number, and birth details-so that when the user fills the form on the web interface, the entered values are saved in this table. From these stored values, the system can render a formatted certificate template and export it as a PDF. More generally, other forms (such as discharge summaries or billing statements) draw from their respective tables (e.g., discharges, invoices, patients, facilities) to generate printable reports without duplicating data. The documents table then serves as a repository for any generated PDFs or uploaded files, storing metadata like file name, file path, type (e.g., birth certificate, patient discharge), and links to the related patient, admission, or birth certificate record. This design ensures that user-filled forms are persisted as structured data, can be reliably converted to PDF for printing, and are archived as documents for future viewing and retrieval.

Objective: To develop a mapping feature that allows users to display nearby birthing homes on a map and allows users to view a patient's consultation history from previously visited birthing homes for referral purposes and also to search registered facilities.

     The schema supports geospatial display and cross-facility care history by combining facility location data, consultation records, and referrals. Facilities store latitude and longitude with city and province, enabling proximity searches and map visualization. Consultations record outpatient visits at any facility, including timing, reason, notes, and attending staff, forming a longitudinal view of encounters across the network. Referrals capture formal transfers of care between facilities for a given patient, preserving the origin, destination, rationale, and creating staff attribution. Together, these entities allow users to search and map registered birthing homes, visualize nearby facilities, and review a patient's consultation and referral history.

Objective: To develop a subscription management module that allows facility owners to subscribe, choose customizable plan options, renew, pay.

     Access control and monetization are handled via plans, subscriptions, and subscription payments linked to facility ownership. Plans define the available offerings, including billing cycles, prices, and limits (e.g., users, storage), enabling configurable tiers. Subscriptions connect a facility to a plan and record status, coverage dates, auto-renew settings, and renewal timestamps, establishing whether and under what conditions a facility may use the system. Subscription payments log each financial transaction against a subscription with amounts, methods, references, and statuses, supporting renewals, dunning, and financial reporting. By tying subscriptions to facilities owned by specific users, the model enforces responsibility and provides a clear, auditable record of plan selection, renewal behavior, and payment history.

Good Day! We, the developers of BirthCare: A Web-Based Birthing Home for Patient Services and Records Management System, would like to request your participation to help us improve the system's functionality. Please indicate if a certain condition meets your user experience using the legend provided below. Your responses will be kept confidential and used solely for educational and testing purposes. Thank you for your time and feedback!

Legend:SD - strongly disagree D - disagreeU - uncertain
SA - strongly agreeA- agree

ConditionSDDUSAAThe system is easy to learn, navigate, and use.The login and access control (user accounts and roles) work reliably and securely.Managing facilities, staff, rooms, and services in the system is clear and efficient.Registering patients and recording their admissions, rooms, and attending staff is easy.The system computes billing charges correctly and records payments accurately.Creating discharge records, prescriptions, and postnatal instructions is straightforward.Filling out forms that can be printed as PDF (e.g., birth certificate, discharge summary) is clear and complete.
The document storage feature (uploading and retrieving patient-related files) works effectively.The mapping and search features help me locate facilities and view patient consultation history.The overall performance and usefulness of the system meet my expectations for birthing home operations.
